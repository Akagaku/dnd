    <h1>Elf</h1>
    <p>
      Elves are one of the most populous races in the Wounded Isles, created when the mischievous denizens of the Feywild transformed a group of
      twelve human warriors into living weapons against the dragons. Stripped of their less useful characteristics—empathy and humanity—they were
      granted strength of body and mind, and long life. Sleepless and ageless, they dedicate their days and nights to training, honing their bodies
      and minds in pursuit of perfection. They are a proud people, and are not likely to bow. It is no small feat to earn the respect of an elf.
    </p>
    <h2>Subrace</h2>
    <p>
      There are two subraces of elf: Sothonian and Alkarian. Choose one of the two subraces before creating your character. You gain all of the
      traits listed under the Elf Traits section, as well as those listed under your chosen subrace.
    </p>
    <h2>Elf Traits</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Your Wisdom score increases by 1.<br>
      <strong>Age.</strong> Elves do not reach physical maturity until the age of 30, and generally aren't considered adults until the age of 100,
      though Sothonian children are deemed combat ready as soon as they can swing a blade.<br>
      <strong>Speed.</strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.
    </p>
    <h2>Sothonian</h2>
    <p>
      The mightiest of the Twelve was a warrior named Sothos. After the fall of the dragons, he founded the first and greatest of what would
      become a network of elven city states. After his death, the city was renamed Sothon in his honor, and would go on to unite the city states
      under the banner of a vast elven state. Though powerful, the kingdom of Sothon would eventually fall to the rising Liran Empire, its
      citizens relegated to immortal servitude. Since the collapse of Old Lira, however, the might of the elves has since been reborn in the form
      of Sothonia, one of many Liran splinter states.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Either your Strength score or Dexterity score increases by 2.<br>
      <strong>Size.</strong> Sothonians tower above both humans and Alkarians, standing between 6 and 7 feet tall. Your size is Medium.<br>
      <strong>Arms of Evrys.</strong> You have proficiency with the shortsword, shortbow, spear, and shield. The armor class bonus provided by
      your shield is increased by 1 while adjacent to an ally.<br>
      <strong>Philosopher Kings.</strong> You have proficiency with two skills from the following list: History, Insight, Medicine, Nature,
      Religion.<br>
      <strong>Dragonslayer.</strong> You have advantage on saving throws against being frightened.
    </p>
    <h2>Alkarian</h2>
    <p>
      At the height of its power, Sothon, led by Evrys the Indomitable, extended its reach across the Wound to a desert known to the native humans
      as "al-Qara min Nar," the Sea of Fire. In a few generations, the population of the region was almost entirely elven and half-elven, but its
      residents kept in touch with their culture and traditions, and grew to resent their Sothonian sires. When the time came, the governors of
      al-Qara, by then known as Alkaria, struck a deal with the Liran Imperator for their independence. In an ironic twist of fate, the fall of
      Sothon left the colony of Alkaria the only independent elven nation for centuries.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Either your Constitution score or Charisma score increases by 2.<br>
      <strong>Wanderer.</strong> You are more resistant to hot climates, and can go twice as long without food or water before suffering from
      exhaustion.<br>
      <strong>Darkvision.</strong> You can see in dim light within 60 feet as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light.
      You can't discern colors in darkness, only shades of gray.<br>
      <strong>Desert Sorcery.</strong> You know either the thaumaturgy cantrip or the prestidigitation cantrip. When you reach 3rd level, you can
      cast Charm Person once as a 1st-level spell. When you reach 5th level, you can also cast Suggestion once. You must finish a long rest to
      cast these spells again with this trait. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells.
