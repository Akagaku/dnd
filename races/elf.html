    <h1>Elf</h1>
    <p>
      Elves are one of the most populous races in the Wounded Isles, created when the mischievous denizens of the Feywild transformed a group of
      twelve human warriors into living weapons against the dragons. Stripped of their less useful characteristics—empathy and humanity—they were
      granted strength of body and mind, and long life. Sleepless and ageless, they dedicate their days and nights to training, honing their bodies
      and minds in pursuit of perfection. They are a proud people, and are not likely to bow. It is no small feat to earn the respect of an elf.
    </p>
    <h2>Subrace</h2>
    <p>
      There are two subraces of elf: Sothonian and Alkarian. Choose one of the two subraces before creating your character. You gain all of the
      traits listed under the Elf Traits section, as well as those listed under your chosen subrace.
    </p>
    <h2>Elf Traits</h2>
    <ul class="trait-list">
      <li>
        <strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Your Wisdom score increases by 1.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Age.</strong> Elves do not reach physical maturity until the age of 30, and generally aren't considered adults until the age of
        100, though Sothonian children are deemed combat ready as soon as they can swing a blade.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Speed.</strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Trance.</strong> Elves don't need to sleep. Instead, they enter a trance-like state for 4 hours a day. After resting in this way,
        you gain the benefit of 8 hours of sleep.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Sothonian</h2>
    <p>
      The mightiest of the Twelve was a warrior named Sothos. After the fall of the dragons, he founded the first and greatest of what would
      become a network of elven city states. After his death, the city was renamed Sothon in his honor, and would go on to unite the city states
      under the banner of a vast elven state. Though powerful, the kingdom of Sothon would eventually fall to the rising Liran Empire, its
      citizens relegated to immortal servitude. Since the collapse of Old Lira, however, the might of the elves has since been reborn in the form
      of Sothonia, one of many Liran splinter states.
    </p>
    <ul class="trait-list">
      <li>
        <strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Either your Strength score or Dexterity score increases by 2.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Size.</strong> Sothonians tower above both humans and Alkarians, standing between 6 and 7 feet tall. Your size is Medium.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Arms of Evrys.</strong> You have proficiency with the shortsword, shortbow, spear, and shield. The armor class bonus provided by
        your shield is increased by 1 while adjacent to at least one ally.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Philosopher Kings.</strong> You have proficiency with two skills from the following list: History, Insight, Medicine, Nature,
        Religion.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Dragonslayer.</strong> You have advantage on saving throws against being frightened.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Languages.</strong> You can speak, read, and write Tenian and Sothonian.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Alkarian</h2>
    <p>
      At the height of its power, Sothon, led by Evrys the Indomitable, extended its reach across the Wound to a desert known to the native humans
      as "al-Qara min Nar," the Sea of Fire. In an ironic twist of fate, the fall of Sothon left the colony of Alkaria as the only independent
      elven nation for centuries. Alkarian elves generally lack the haughty self-opinion of their cousins in the north, and are much friendlier
      and have a reputation as learned scholars and shrewd merchants.
    </p>
    <ul class="trait-list">
      <li>
        <strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Either your Constitution score or Charisma score increases by 2.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Wanderer.</strong> You are more resistant to hot climates, and can go twice as long without food or water before suffering from
        exhaustion.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Darkvision.</strong> You can see in dim light within 60 feet as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light.
        You can't discern colors in darkness, only shades of gray.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Desert Sorcery.</strong> You know the Prestidigitation cantrip. When you reach 3rd level, you can cast Charm Person once as a
        1st-level spell, using Charisma as your spellcasting ability. You must finish a long rest to cast it again with this trait.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Languages.</strong> You can speak, read, and write Tenian and Alkarian.
      </li>
    </ul>
