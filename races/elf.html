    <h1>Elf</h1>
    <p>
      Magical and foreign, yet strange and alien at the same time, elves are a race of people descended from a group known simply as the Twelve:
      twelve human warriors experimented on by unseelie fey. They were engineered as living weapons to be used against the dragons, and stripped of
      their less useful instincts—emotion, empathy, and humanity—in exchange for wisdom and long life. Though once the ruling class of a powerful
      empire, elves have since been dethroned, and even relegated to the role of second rate citizens in some parts of the world.
    </p>

    <h2>Uncanny Visage</h2>
    <p>
      When the first elves were created, their fey influence manifested in eerie, slightly inhuman ways. They were thin and unnaturally
      tall, and all pigment was drained from their hair, skin, and eyes, making them frighteningly pale. Though this is still true of many moon
      elves, these features become more diluted each generation, preserved only by the elves' long lives and slow breeding
      cycle. Modern elves are often more similar in color to humans than to their ancestors.
    </p>
    <p>  
      Though few mind such superficial changes, with their feylike features fades their magical nature, leading the ancient moon elves to depart
      the material plane for the Feywild in an attempt to recapture their supernatural properties. The Alkarian sun elves are an example of the
      state of decay affecting elf lineage, harboring little if any connection to the Feywild and elven customs.
    </p>

    <h2>The Bones of an Empire</h2>
    <p>
      The end of the Age of Dragons saw the rise of the Age of the Elves. For thousands of years, the kingdom of Sothon ruled over most of the
      northern isle, and their reach included even the desert region of Alkaria on southern isle. Today, the isles are blanketed with Sothonian
      ruins. Several families of moon elves still cling desperately to the remnants of their fallen houses, tracking lineages and collecting
      heirlooms.
    </p>

    <h2>Names</h2>
    <p>
      Unlike humans, an elf will typically only have a single name. Due to differences in culture and language, each elven subrace has its own
      name list, though some Alkarians still bear traditionally Sothonian names.
    </p>
    <h3>Sothonian</h3>
    <p><em>Inspiration: Greek</em></p>
    <p>
      <strong>Male Names:</strong> Sothon, Nolemos, Evrys
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Female Names:</strong> Sotha, 
    </p>
    <h3>Alkarian</h3>
    <p><em>Inspiration: Arabic</em></p>
    <p>
      <strong>Male Names:</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Female Names:</strong>
    </p>

    <h2>Subrace</h2>
    <p>
      There are two subraces of elf: Sothonian and Alkarian. Choose one of the two subraces before creating your character. You gain all of the
      traits listed under the Elf Traits section, as well as those listed under your chosen subrace.
    </p>
    <h2>Elf Traits</h2>
    <p>Your elf character has a variety of natural abilities, a result of fey magic and millennia of elven tradition.</p>
    <ul class="trait-list">
      <li>
        <strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Your Wisdom score increases by 1.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Age.</strong> Elves do not reach physical maturity until the age of 30, and generally aren't considered adults until the age of
        100, though Sothonian children are deemed combat ready as soon as they can swing a blade.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Speed.</strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Trance.</strong> Elves don't need to sleep. Instead, they enter a trance-like state for 4 hours a day. After resting in this way,
        you gain the benefit of 8 hours of sleep.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Sothonian</h3>
    <p>
      Also called moon elves, Sothonians are the children of Sothon, the first city of the elven dominion founded by and named for the warrior
      Sothos. They have historically had stark white hair, skin, and eyes. Over the centuries, however, the blood of the feytouched has thinned,
      and gray-eyed elves with more humanlike hair and skin are not uncommon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sothonian tradition is particularly warlike. Gladiators fight for the entertainment of the masses, and feats of strength are ritually
      performed on holidays. However, they also value strength of mind as much as strength of arm. Many advances in philosphy were made by
      Sothonian scholars, and Sothon was home to the most imporant scientific institutions of its age.
    </p>
    <ul class="trait-list">
      <li>
        <strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Either your Strength score or Dexterity score increases by 2.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Size.</strong> Sothonians tower above both humans and Alkarians, standing between 6 and 7 feet tall. Your size is Medium.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Arms of Evrys.</strong> You have proficiency with the shortsword, shortbow, spear, and shield. The armor class bonus provided by
        your shield is increased by 1 while adjacent to at least one ally.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Philosopher Kings.</strong> You have proficiency with two skills of your choice from History, Insight, Medicine, Nature, and
        Religion.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Dragonslayer.</strong> You have advantage on saving throws against being frightened.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Languages.</strong> You can speak, read, and write Tenian and Sothonian.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Alkarian</h3>
    <p>
      At the height of its power, Sothon, led by Evrys the Indomitable, extended its reach across the Wound to a desert known to the deserts of
      Alkaria. In an ironic twist of fate, the fall of Sothon left the Alkarian colony as the only independent elven nation for many centuries.
      Millennia of interbreeding with the native humans resulted in a strain of elf known as sun elves, shorter and darker of hair and skin, and
      green or brown of eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      Due to their admiration for the culture of their human ancestors, the sun elves aren't nearly as aggerssive as the children of Sothon, but
      are no less shrewd. They are merchants and traders, scholars and mathematicians, wise men and sorcerers. Harazal, the nocturnal City of Gold,
      is the capital of Alkaria, and has made its name as one of the leading economic powers in the world.
    </p>
