    <h1>Dragonborn</h1>
    <p>
      Before the days of men and elves and dwarves, and before the Wound parted the Isles, the land and skies were ruled by an empire of dragons.
      Few yet live, if any, but the legacy of the mighty wyrms survives through the dragonborn. Seeking to usurp the dragons' power, ancient human
      shamans conducted foul rituals using the blood of those slain by the first elves, twisting themselves into the humanoid reptiles that are
      now commonplace throughout the world. Metallic dragonborn are rare, gem dragonborn even more so.
    </p>
    <h2>Subrace</h2>
    <p>
      Dragonborn have different traits depending on their draconic heritage, resulting in three subraces: chromatic, metallic, and gem. Choose one
      of the three subraces before creating your character. You gain all of the traits listed under the Dragonborn Traits section, as well as
      those listed under your chosen subrace.
    </p>
    <h2>Dragonborn Traits</h2>
    <ul class="trait-list">
      <li>
        <strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Your Strength score increases by 2.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Age.</strong> Young dragonborn grow quickly. They walk hours after hatching, and reach adulthood by 12. They live to be around 60.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Size.</strong> Dragonborn are taller and heavier than humans, standing well over 6 feet tall and averaging almost 250 pounds. Your
        size is Medium.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Speed.</strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Damage Resistance.</strong> You have resistance to the damage type associated with your draconic ancestry (specified in the tables
        below).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Breath Weapon.</strong> When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can replace one of your attacks with a breath attack.
        Each creature in the attack's area must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus). On a
        failed save, the creature takes 1d10 damage of the type associated with your draconic ancestry. On a successful save, it takes half as
        much damage. This damage increases by 1d10 when you reach 5th level (2d10), 11th level (3d10), and 17th level (4d10). You can use your
        Breath Weapon a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Chromatic</h2>
    <p>
      These dragonborn are descended from the chromatic dragons of old who rose up against their metallic fathers, leading to the civil war that
      would spark the downfall of dragonkind. Their inherent immunity to dragon breath attacks made them adept kinslayers, and their might and
      number drove even the proud dwarves to seal themselves away under the earth. Though they are the most common dragonborn, they can't seem to
      escape the shadow of their malevolent forebears, and are sometimes hunted and killed for sport. Their scales are colorful but dull, a pale
      reflection of the metallic dragons of old.
    </p>
    <ul class="trait-list">
      <li>
        <strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Your Constitution score increases by 1.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Chromatic Ancestry.</strong> Your draconic ancestry is based on one of the dragon types from the table below.
      </li>

        <strong>Hide of the Usurpers.</strong> As an action, you can channel your draconic energy to protect yourself. For 1 minute, you are
        immune to the damage type associated with your ancestry. Once you use this trait, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Metallic</h2>
    <p>
      Heirs to the blood of the metallic lords, metallic dragonborn are the closest things living to the children of Bahamut. As the metallic
      dragons had already suffered tremendous losses by the time dragon blood sorcery was discovered by humans, metallic dragonborn are somewhat
      of a rare sight. Many still see them as mythological symbols of virtue, living remnants of an ancient good long thought destroyed. Their
      bodies are coated in brilliant scales of gleaming metal, which shine in the sunlight.

      <li class="trait-list">
        <strong>Breath of Bahamut.</strong> You have a second breath weapon. When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can replace one of
        your attacks with an exhalation in a 15-foot cone. The save DC for this breath is 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus.
        Whenever you use this trait, choose one of the following options:
        <ul style="margin-top: 1rem;">
          <li>
            <strong>Enervating Breath.</strong> Each creature in the cone must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become incapacitated
            until the start of your next turn.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Repulsion Breath.</strong> Each creature in the cone must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed 20 feet away from
            you and be knocked prone.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Gem</h2>
    <p>
      When the civil war began, some younger metallic dragons fled their homes out of fear, tunneling deep into the earth and ever after living in
      gem-filled caverns in the deep. Over the course of thousands of years, they adapted to the psionic energy emitted by the gemstones, and were
      slowly transformed in a process similar to that which created the gem dwarves of Despin. Knowledge of the gem dragons is scant even among
      the most learned of scholars, and, as such, gem dragonborn are incredibly rare. Unlike other dragons, gem dragons and gem dragonborn have no
      scales. Instead, their skin is hard, smooth, and polished. Broken pieces of their horns and bodies float diligently in their places due to
      their inherent psionic power.
    </p>
    <ul class="trait-list">
