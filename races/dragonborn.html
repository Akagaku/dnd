    <h1>Dragonborn</h1>
    <p>
      Before the days of men and elves and dwarves, and before the Wound parted the Isles, the land and skies were ruled by a nation of dragons.
      Few yet live, if any, but the legacy of the mighty wyrms survives through the dragonborn. Seeking to usurp the dragons' power, ancient human
      shamans conducted foul rituals using the blood of those slain by the first elves, twisting themselves into the humanoid reptiles that are
      now commonplace throughout the world. Metallic dragonborn are rare, gem dragonborn even more so.
    </p>

    <h2>Heirs of the Dragons</h2>
    <p>
      The dragon children of Bahamut presided over the world for untold millennia before even the dwarves came to be. Their reign, however, came to
      an end when the evil dragon god Tiamat, whom Bahamut imprisoned beneath his palace, escaped her bonds with the help of unseelie fey
      tricksters. The two engaged in the Battle of the Drake Lords, the first battle of the War of the Usurpers. In a draw, both plummeted to the
      earth below, wounding the isles.
    </p>
    <p>
      The remaining dragons were thrust into bloody civil war, becoming easy prey for the elves, who wiped nearly every one of them out. Today,
      whatever dragons survived the war are in hiding, while dragonborn have become commonplace throughout the world.
    </p>

    <h2>Dark and Twisted Sorcery</h2>
    <p>
      An early human shaman discovered the secrets of an ancient blood ritual now lost to time. Using the blood of the dragons who died in the War
      of the Usurpers, he turned his followers into the first dragonborn. They gained immeasurable strength and took on the aspect of the dragon,
      at the cost of their lifespan. It is said that the shaman himself imbibed the blood of Tiamat, and lurks among the mountains and caves of the
      world to this day.
    </p>

    <h2>Names</h2>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Male Names:</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Female Names:</strong>
    </p>

    <h2>Subrace</h2>
    <p>
      Dragonborn have different traits depending on their draconic heritage, resulting in three subraces: chromatic, metallic, and gem. Choose one
      of the three subraces before creating your character. You gain all of the traits listed under the Dragonborn Traits section, as well as
      those listed under your chosen subrace.
    </p>
    <h2>Dragonborn Traits</h2>
    <p>The power of the dragons' blood grants dragonborn a number of inehrent supernatural abilities.</p>
    <ul class="trait-list">
      <li>
        <strong><em>Ability Score Increase.</em></strong> Your Strength score increases by 2.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong><em>Age.</em></strong> Young dragonborn grow quickly. They walk hours after hatching, and reach adulthood by 10. They live to be around 40.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong><em>Size.</em></strong> Dragonborn are taller and heavier than humans, standing well over 6 feet tall and averaging almost 250 pounds. Your
        size is Medium.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong><em>Speed.</em></strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong><em>Damage Resistance.</em></strong> You have resistance to the damage type associated with your draconic ancestry (determined by your
        subrace).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong><em>Breath Weapon.</em></strong> When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can replace one of your attacks with a breath
        attack. Each creature in the attack's area must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency
        bonus). On a failed save, the creature takes 1d10 damage of the type associated with your draconic ancestry. On a successful save, it takes
        half as much damage. This damage increases by 1d10 when you reach 5th level (2d10), 11th level (3d10), and 17th level (4d10). You can use
        your Breath Weapon a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Chromatic</h2>
    <p>
      These dragonborn are descended from the chromatic dragons who rose up against their metallic fathers, leading to the war that sparked the
      downfall of dragonkind. Their immunity to dragon breath attacks made them adept kinslayers, and their might and number drove even the proud
      dwarves to hide under the earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though they are the most common type of dragonborn, they can't seem to escape the shadow of their malevolent forebears, and are sometimes
      killed for sport by moon elves. Their scales are colorful but dull, a pale reflection of the metallic dragons of old.
    </p>
    <ul class="trait-list">
      <li>
        <strong><em>Ability Score Increase.</em></strong> Your Constitution score increases by 1.

      <li>
        <strong><em>Chromatic Ancestry.</em></strong> Your draconic ancestry is based on one of the dragon types from the table below.

    <ul class="trait-list">
      <li>
        <strong><em>Hide of the Usurpers.</em></strong> As an action, you can channel your draconic energy to protect yourself. For 1 minute, you
        become immune to the damage type associated with your ancestry. Once you use this trait, you can't do so again until you finish a long
        rest.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Metallic</h2>
    <p>
      Heirs to the blood of the platinum, these dragonborn are the closest known living things to the descendants of Bahamut. As the metallic
      dragons had already suffered tremendous losses by the time dragon blood sorcery was discovered by humans, dragonborn of this type are
      somewhat of a rare sight, though more common than gem dragons.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their bodies are coated in brilliant scales of gleaming metal, which shine in the sunlight. Some see them as living symbols of good and
      virtue, remnants of a bygone era when law and compassion ruled the world, though since no living creature can remember that age, these views
      are highly romanticized.

    </table>
    <ul class="trait-list">
      <li>
        <strong><em>Breath of Bahamut.</em></strong> You have a second breath weapon. When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can replace
        one of your attacks with an exhalation in a 15-foot cone. The save DC for this breath is 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency
        bonus. Whenever you use this trait, choose one of the following options:
        <ul style="margin-top: 1rem;">
          <li>
            <strong><em>Enervating Breath.</em></strong> Each creature in the cone must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become
            incapacitated until the start of your next turn.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong><em>Repulsion Breath.</em></strong> Each creature in the cone must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed 20 feet away
            from you and be knocked prone.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Gem</h2>
    <p>
      When the civil war began, a few chromatic dragons chased the dwarves of Stengrotto into the Underdark, tunneling deep into the earth and ever
      after living in gem-filled caverns in the deep. Over the course of thousands of years, they adapted to the psionic energy emitted by the
      gemstones, and were slowly transformed in a process similar to that which created the gem dwarves of Despin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Knowledge of the gem dragons is scant even among the most learned of scholars, and, as such, gem dragonborn are incredibly rare. Unlike other
      dragons, gem dragons and gem dragonborn have no scales. Instead, their skin is hard, smooth, and polished. Broken pieces of their horns and
      bodies float diligently in their places due to their inherent psionic power.
