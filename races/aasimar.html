    <h1>Aasimar</h1>
    <p>
      Aasimar are one of four species of planetouched on Materion. They are the descendants of humans who were blessed by the celestials who dwell
      in the upper planes, and bear a holy light wihtin their souls. They hear the voices of powerful outsiders in their minds, and many of the
      more superstitious folk in the Isles believe their kind are bound to some greater destiny. Many aasimar make this prophecy a reality, though
      they must be careful in doing so, lest they attract the attention of an eager fiend.
    </p>
    <h2>Subrace</h2>
    <p>
      Aasimar have different traits depending on their celestial heritage, resulting in three subraces: mana, alkon, and couatl. Choose one of the
      three subraces before creating your character. You gain all of the traits listed under the Aasimar Traits section, as well as those listed
      under your chosen subrace.
    </p>
    <h2>Aasimar Traits</h2>
    <ul class="trait-list">
      <li>
        <strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Your Charisma score increases by 2.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Age.</strong> Aasimar mature at the same rate as humans, but can live for up to 150 years.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Speed.</strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Celestial Blood.</strong> You have resistance to radiant damage.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Otherworldly Liaison.</strong> A powerful celestial communicates with you through prayer, dreams, and visions, whether you realize
        it or not. When you take a long rest, you can ask advice of it, and may receive an answer at the end of the rest.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Languages.</strong> You can speak, read, and write Tenian and one other language of your choice.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Mana</h2>
    <p>
      "Mana," synonymous with greater celestial, is a blanket term to define a group of three species: solar, lunar, and planetar. These heavenly
      kings and queens of the upper planes created all other, "lesser" celestials to serve them. They are similar in some ways—like their imposing
      stature, otherworldly ability, and smooth, pupil-less eyes—though at the same time, each is distinct in appearance, and their descendants
      reflect their unique traits. Solar aasimar have topaz eyes, and metallic skin and hair of brass, bronze, or gold. Lunar aasimar have glowing
      white eyes, silver or pale blue hair, and milky white or gray skin. Planetar aasimar have light emerald skin and shining, opalescent eyes.
    </p>
    <ul class="trait-list">
      <li>
        <strong>Size.</strong> Towering above normal humans and other aasimar, mana aasimar can stand anywhere from 6 feet and a half to nearly 8
        feet tall. Your size is Medium.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Heavenly Light.</strong> You know the Light cantrip. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for it.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Searing Soul.</strong> When you take damage from a melee attack made by a creature within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction
        to deal radiant damage to the attacker equal to 1d4 + your Charisma modifier (minimum 1 damage).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Lords of the Beyond.</strong> Your angelic appearance incites shock and awe. As an action, choose one creature that can see you
        within 30 feet of you. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC = 8 + your Charisma modifier + your proficiency bonus) or be either
        charmed or frightened until the beginning of your next turn. Once you use this trait, you must finish a short or long rest before you can
        use it again.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Alkon</h2>
    <p>
      These aasimar are descended from alkon, the messengers of the mana. They are also the most immediately recognizable celestials due to their
      large and powerful birdlike talons, which their descendants share. All those with the blood of the alkon possess the ability to fly upon
      wings of fire, and to sense when they are being lied to, powers both originally bestowed upon the first alkon by the solar. Alkon aasimar
      generally have some shade of red hair to match their fiery wings, and are very unlikely—almost unable—to betray their principles, friends,
      or masters.
    </p>
    <ul class="trait-list">
      <li>
        <strong>Size.</strong> Lesser aasimar more or less mirror humans in height. Your size is Medium.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Talon Scratch.</strong> You can make unarmed strikes which deal 1d6 slashing damage.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Burning Wings.</strong> As an action, you sprout massive wings of flame from your back, granting you a flying speed of 60 feet
        until the end of your turn. Once you use this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can use it again.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Detect Lies.</strong> You have proficiency with the Insight skill. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any Wisdom (Insight)
        check made to discern truth from lie.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Couatl</h2>
    <p>
      Couatl aasimar are descended from the majestic winged serpents who serve as the mana's emissaries on the material plane. Legend says they
      cannot lie, but their humanoid descendants are luckily subject to no such restriction, for the most part. What they do inherit from their
      celestial forebears is their shapechanging abilities, resistance to scrying, and small, iridescent scales which become visible as they
      faintly glitter in light. Their colorful eyes also seem to shift hue like a crystal prism when under direct sunlight. A couatl aasimar may
      have any range of natural hair colors, as well as shades of blue, white, orange, and red.
    </p>
    <ul class="trait-list">
      <li>
        <strong>Size.</strong> Lesser aasimar more or less mirror humans in height. Your size is Medium.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Coat of Scales.</strong> While not wearing armor, your armor class increases by 2. This bonus increases to 3 at 10th level.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Impenetrable Mind.</strong> You have advantage on saving throws against scrying, as well as any effect that would read your
        thoughts or emotions.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Change Form.</strong> You can cast Alter Self once. You must finish a short or long rest before you can cast it again with this
        trait.
      </li>
    </ul>
