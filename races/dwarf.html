    <h1>Dwarf</h1>
    <p>
      None living know quite how the dwarves came to be, nor where or when. The secrets of their origin are lost even to the dwarves themselves.
      All that <em>is</em> known is that they've been carving stone and digging tunnels since the days of dragons. Long is their history and wide
      their domain, but divided their people and few their number. They have survived longer than any other sentient species, and have endured
      through dragon's fire and elf's spear both. Their strongholds are magnificent, and their craftsmanship is legendary.
    </p>

    <h2>Subrace</h2>
    <p>
      Over the millenia, the isolation of the dwarven strongholds has resulted in five distinct subraces: stone, iron, silver, coal, and gem.
      Choose one of the five subraces before creating your character. You gain all of the traits listed under the Dwarf Traits section, as well as
      those listed under your chosen subrace.
    </p>
    <h2>Dwarf Traits</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Age.</strong> Dwarves mature at the same rate as humans, but are considered children until the age of 60. The typical dwarf lifespan
      is between 500 and 600 years.<br>
      <strong>Size.</strong> Dwarves are shorter than humans, the average adult dwarf being the size of a human child: between 4 and 5 feet tall.
      Your size is Medium.<br>
      <strong>Studied Architects.</strong> Whenever you make an Intelligence (History) check related to the origin of stonework or metalwork, you
      are considered proficient in the History skill and add double your proficiency bonus to the check, instead of your normal proficiency bonus.
      <br>
      <strong>Darkvision.</strong> You can see in dim light within 60 feet as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light.
      You can't discern colors in darkness, only shades of gray.
    </p>
    <h2>Stone</h2>
    <p>
      The stone dwarves, or Fjellan dwarves, are the most common species of dwarf in the Isles. They come from Korblok, the oldest and largest of
      all dwarven strongholds. Their hair and eyes often come in shades of gray and faded earthtones, and they possess the toughness and endurance
      of solid rock. They have a strong sense of dwarven pride, and appreciate fine craftsmanship more than any other dwarves.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Your Constitution score and your Wisdom score each increase by 1.<br>
      <strong>Powerlifter.</strong> You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or
      lift.<br>
      <strong>Stout Endurance.</strong> When you are reduced to 0 or fewer hit points but not killed outright, you can choose to instead be
      reduced to 1 hit point. Once you use this feature, you must finish a long rest to use this trait again.<br>
      <strong>Languages.</strong> You can speak, read, and write Tenian and Fjellan.
    </p>
    <h2>Iron</h2>
    <p>
      The iron dwarves, also known as Bjor dwarves, come from Staldor, the largest iron mine on the northern isle. If you see a red-haired dwarf,
      it's safe to assume it's a Bjor. Their close relationship with metallurgy makes them well-adjusted to heat, and most have picked up some
      combat training with the weapons they craft. The most hot headed dwarves by far, they are not likely to take any insult or offense lying
      down.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Your Strength score increases by 2.<br>
      <strong>Molten Metal.</strong> You have resistance to fire damage.<br>
      <strong>Heavy Hitter.</strong> When you roll a 1 with a damage die, you can reroll that die. You must use the new roll, even if it is
      another 1.<br>
      <strong>Languages.</strong> You can speak, read, and write Tenian and Bjoric.
    </p>
    <h2>Silver</h2>
    <p>
      Silver dwarves, also known as Myntian dwarves, come from Slottrik, the largest source of silver in the world. As the holders of such a
      valuable resource, they are as much charming merchants as they are hardy miners. Myntians are easily identified by their gray or white hair,
      laden with sparkling silver dust particles. The most social of the dwarves, they are boastful and inviting, and aren't above resorting to
      some light trickery to secure a sale.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Your Charisma score increases by 2.<br>
      <strong>Mercantile Charm.</strong> You have proficiency with the Persuasion skill, and your proficiency bonus is doubled for any Charisma
      (Persuasion) check made to bargain or haggle the price of an item.<br>
      <strong>Conductive.</strong> You have resistance to lightning damage.<br>
      <strong>Languages.</strong> You can speak, read, and write Tenian and Myntian.
    </p>
    <h2>Coal</h2>
    <p>
      Coal dwarves, also known as Rull dwarves, come from Vargift, an ancient coal mine. Their hair is typically black, whether natural or stained
      with coal dust. Every Rull carries an iron mask used to filter the toxic air from the depths of their mines, each with a unique design.
      Unlike the average stone or iron dwarf, they are stoic and reserved, accustomed to conserving as much of their breath as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Your Constitution score increases by 2.<br>
      <strong>Toxin Resilience.</strong> You have advantage on saving throws against poison, and you have resistance to posion damage.<br>
      <strong>Lung Capacity.</strong> The amount of time you can hold your breath is doubled.<br>
      <strong>Languages.</strong> You can speak, read, and write Tenian and Rullic.
    </p>
    <h2>Gem</h2>
    <p>
      Gem dwarves, also known as Edelian dwarves, are the least common species of dwarf in the isles. They come from Despin, a hidden cave network
      rich with gemstones. Though each pale-skinned Edelian's colorful hair mimics the shade of a particular gem, the first thing you're likely to
      notice is the far-away look in his eye, or his alien mannerisms. Oftentimes they will forget to speak altogether, as they are so used to
      communicating telepathically with one another.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Your Intelligence score increases by 1.<br>
      <strong>Telepathy.</strong> You can communicate telepathically with any creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The creature cannot
      respond telepathically. You do not need to share a language, but the creature must know at least one language to understand you.<br>
      <strong>Psionic Spellcasting.</strong> You know the Mage Hand cantrip. When you reach 3rd level, you can cast Detect Thoughts once. When you
      reach 5th level, you can also cast Dispel Magic once as a 3rd-level spell. You must finish a long rest to cast these spells again with this
      trait. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for these spells, and they do not require spell components.<br>
      <strong>Sunlight Sensitivity.</strong> While in sunlight, you have disadvantage on Attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks
      that rely on sight.<br>
      <strong>Languages.</strong> You can speak, read, and write Tenian and Edelian.
