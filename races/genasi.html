    <h1>Genasi</h1>
    <p>
      The Wounded Isles are home to many a strange and alien creature. Perhaps none are so otherworldly—yet at the same time, so human—as genasi.
      They are the half-human children of genies, elementals known to mingle with mortals. Though less common than humans, one is far more likely
      to encounter a genasi than an aasimar or tiefling. Though generally fun-loving and free-spirited, they are also dangerous, and carry magical
      powers of the elemental planes.
    </p>

    <h2>Colorfully Varied</h2>
    <p>
      As diverse as the material plane may be, it is a pale imitation of the sheer variety and magnitude of different peoples and species that
      dwell within the rest of the planes. Genius are flamboyant and audacious beings, and their genasi children are a reflection of this. At a
      glance, they are immediately identifiable due to this distinctive nature, though each of the four types has its own unique qualities.
    </p>

    <h2>Blood of the Inner Planes</h2>
    <p>
      Unlike humans and dwarves, genasi aren't wholly native to the material plane. They are descended from the elemental planes, which, along
      with the material plane, are known collectively as the inner planes.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Names</h2>
    <p>

    </p>

    <h2>Subrace</h2>
    <p>
      Genasi have different traits depending on their heritage, resulting in four subraces: efreeti, djinn, marid, and dao. Choose one of the
      four subraces before creating your character. You gain all of the traits listed under the Aasimar Traits section, as well as those listed
      under your chosen subrace.
    </p>
    <h2>Genasi Traits</h2>
    <ul class="trait-list">
      <li>
        <strong>Age.</strong> Genasi mature at the same rate as humans, but can live up to 120 years.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Size.</strong> Genasi are similar to humans in height and build. Your size is Medium.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Speed.</strong>Your base walking speed is 30 feet.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Efreeti</h2>
    <p>
      Efreet (singular "efreeti") are genies native to the plane of fire. While they hold honor in high regard, they can be cruel and
      unpredictable, and are very difficult to bind. As the children of efreet, these genasi are hotheaded and short-tempered, yet also keen of
      mind. They also carry a strong sense of pride. Efreeti genasi have skin the color of flames, coal, or ash, and their eyes flare when
      angered. Some have writhing, fiery red hair, while others sport actual flames atop their heads.
    </p>
    <ul class="trait-list">
    <li>
      <strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Your Intelligence score increases by 2.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Blood of Fire.</strong> You have resistance to fire damage.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Burning Blade.</strong> As an action, you can cause your weapon to burst into flame. For 1 minute, you can add an extra 1d5 fire
      damage to one attack you make each turn.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Reach to the Blaze.</strong> You know the Produce Flame cantrip. When you reach 3rd level, you can cast the Burning Hands spell once
      as a 1st-level spell. You must finish a long rest to cast it again with this trait. Constitution is your spellcasting ability for these
      spells.
    </li>
  </ul>

    <h2>Djinni</h2>
    <p>
      The djinn (singular "djinni"), though they dwell in the plane of air, were born in the maelstrom of the elemental chaos. Although powerful
      and wild by nature, they are also benevolent and forgiving. The djinn, and most of their genasi children, are optimistically resigned to
      their faith in the chains of fate. Even those imprisoned and forced into servitude see their bondage as part of a greater destiny. Djinni
      genasi have white or light blue skin, and gray hair that darkens with their mood. A gentle yet constant breeze seems to accompany them
      wherever they go.
    </p>
    <ul class="trait-list">
      <li>
        <strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Your Dexterity score increases by 2.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Unending Breath.</strong> You can hold your breath indefinitely while you are not incapacitated.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Featherweight.</strong> You are treated as being one size larger when determining how much you can carry, lift, push, and drag.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Mingle With the Wind.</strong> You can cast Levitate once, requiring no spell components. You must finish a long rest before you
        can cast it again with this trait.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Marid</h2>
    <p>
      In addition to being the largest genies, marids are considered by some to be the greatest in power. And the marids certainly agree. To them,
      mortals and even other genies are beneath their notice. As such, they are more susceptible to flattery than other genies, but are rarely
      bound by mages due to their massive power and even larger egos. Marid genasi, though to a lesser degree, inherit their ancestors' lordly
      attitudes. Their skin and hair mimic the blue and greens of the seas, always glistening with moisture, and their hair appears to float behind
      them as if underwater.
    </p>
    <ul class="trait-list">
      <li>
        <strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Your Charisma score increases by 2.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Body of Water.</strong> You have resistance to acid damage.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Amphibious.</strong> You have a swim speed of 30 feet, and can breathe in water as well as air.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Call to the Wave.</strong> You know the Shape Water cantrip. When you reach 3rd level, you can cast Create or Destroy Water as a
        2nd-level spell once. You must finish a long rest before you can cast it again with this trait.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Dao</h2>
    <p>
      The dao are the lords of the plane of earth, cruel, greedy, and vengeful. They see no wrong in taking others as slaves to serve their
      industrious society. But acts of kindness and good will they are always eager to repay. Many of their half-mortal children share this
      mentality: return all kindness, yet forget no ill. Dao genasi may have smooth, polished-looking skin in deep earth tones, shining metallic
      flesh, dull iron skin spotted with rust, a rough and pebbled hide, or even a coating of tiny embedded crystals. Some may even have fissures
      in their flesh, from which faint light shines.
    </p>
    <ul class="trait-list">
      <li>
        <strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Your Strength score increases by 2.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Meld With Rock.</strong> You can move across difficult terrain made of earth and stone without expending extra movement.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Mastery Over Earth.</strong> You know the Mold Earth cantrip. When you reach 3rd level, you can cast Earth Tremor as a 1st-level
        spell once, using Constitution as your spellcasting ability. You must finish a long rest to cast it again with this trait.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Fists of Stone.</strong> Your unarmed strikes deal 1d6 bludgeoning damage.
      </li>
