    <h1>Class Features</h1>
    <p>As a warlock, you gain the following class features.</p>

    <h3>Hit Points</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Hit Dice:</strong> 1d8 per warlock level<br>
      <strong>Hit Points at 1st Level:</strong> 8 + your Consitution modifier<br>
      <strong>Hit Points at Higher Levels:</strong> 1d8 (or 5) + your Consitution modifier<br>
    </p>
    <h3>Proficiencies</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Armor:</strong> Light armor<br>
      <strong>Weapons:</strong> Simple weapons<br>
      <strong>Tools:</strong> None<br>
      <strong>Saving Throws:</strong>Wisdom, Charisma<br>
      <strong>Skills:</strong> Choose two from Arcana, Deception, History, Intimidation, Investigation, Nature, and Religion
    </p>
    <h3>Equipment</h3>
    <p>You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>(a) a light crossbow and 20 bolts or (b) any simple weapon</li>
      <li>(a) a component pouch or (b) an arcane focus</li>
      <li>(a) a scholar's pack or (b) a dungeoneer's pack</li>
      <li>leather armor, any simple weapon, and two daggers</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="otherworldly-patron">Otherworldly Patron</h2>
    <p>
      At 1st level, you have struck a bargain with an otherworldly being of your choice. Choose <a href="warlock/archfey.html">Archfey</a>,
      <a href="warlock/celestial.html">Celestial</a>, <a href="warlock/fathomless.html">Fathomless</a>, <a href="warlock/fiend.html">Fiend</a>,
      <a href="warlock/genie.html">Genie</a>, <a href="warlock/great-old-one.html">Great Old One</a>,
      <a href="warlock/hexblade.html">Hexblade</a>, <a href="warlock/undead.html">Undead</a>, or <a href="warlock/undying.html">Undying</a>. Your
      choice grants you features at 1st level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.
    </p>

    <h2 id="pact-magic">Pact Magic</h2>
    <p>Your arcane research and the magic bestowed on you by your patron have given you facility with spells.</p>

    <h3>Cantrips</h3>
    <p>
      You know two cantrips of your choice from the warlock spell list. You learn additional warlock cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as
      shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Warlock table.
    </p>

    <h3>Spell Slots</h3>
    <p>
      The Warlock table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your warlock spells of 1st through 5th level. The table also shows what the
      level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your warlock spells of 1st level or higher, you must
      expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, when you are 5th level, you have two 3rd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell witch bolt, you must spend one of those
      slots, and you cast it as a 3rd-level spell.
    </p>

    <h3>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</h3>
    <p>At 1st level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the warlock spell list.</p>
    <p>
      The Spells Known column of the Warlock table shows when you learn more warlock spells of your choice of 1st level or higher. A spell you
      choose must be of a level no higher than what's shown in the table's Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 6th level, for
      example, you learn a new warlock spell, which can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the warlock spells you know and replace it with another spell from
      the warlock spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
    </p>

    <h3>Spellcasting Ability</h3>
    <p>
      Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your warlock spells, so you use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting
      ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a warlock spell you cast and when making an attack
      roll with one.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Spell save DC =</strong> 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>
    <p><strong>Spell attack modifier =</strong> your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>

    <h3>Spellcasting Focus</h3>
    <p>You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your warlock spells.</p>

    <h2 id="eldritch-invocations">Eldritch Invocations</h2>
    <p>
      In your study of occult lore, you have unearthed <a href="warlock/eldritch-invocations.html">Eldritch Invocations</a>, fragments of
      forbidden knowledge that imbue you with an abiding magical ability.
    </p>
    <p>
      At 2nd level, you gain two eldritch invocations of your choice. When you gain certain warlock levels, you gain additional invocations of
      your choice, as shown in the Invocations Known column of the Warlock table. A level prerequisite refers to your level in this class.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the invocations you know and replace it with another invocation
      that you could learn at that level.
    </p>

    <h2>Pact Boon</h2>
    <p>
      At 3rd level, your otherworldly patron bestows a gift upon you for your loyal service. You gain one of the following features of your choice.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Pact of the Blade</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            You can use your action to create a pact weapon in your empty hand. You can choose the form that this melee weapon takes each time you
            create it. You are proficient with it while you wield it. This weapon counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and
            immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.
          </li>
          <li>
            Your pact weapon disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more. It also disappears if you use this feature
            again, if you dismiss the weapon (no action required), or if you die.
          </li>
          <li>
            You can transform one magic weapon into your pact weapon by performing a special ritual while you hold the weapon. You perform the
            ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest.
          </li>
          <li>
            You can then dismiss the weapon, shunting it into an extradimensional space, and it appears whenever you create your pact weapon
            thereafter. You can't affect an artifact or a sentient weapon in this way. The weapon ceases being your pact weapon if you die, if you
            perform the 1-hour ritual on a different weapon, or if you use a 1-hour ritual to break your bond to it. The weapon appears at your
            feet if it is in the extradimensional space when the bond breaks.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Pact of the Chain</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>You learn the find familiar spell and can cast it as a ritual. The spell doesn't count against your number of spells known.</li>
          <li>
            When you cast the spell, you can choose one of the normal forms for your familiar or one of the following special forms: imp,
            pseudodragon, quasit, or sprite.
          </li>
          <li>
            Additionally, when you take the Attack action, you can forgo one of your own attacks to allow your familiar to use its reaction to
            make one attack with its reaction.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Pact of the Tome</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Your patron gives you a grimoire called a Book of Shadows. When you gain this feature, choose three cantrips from any class's spell
            list (the three needn't be from the same list). While the book is on your person, you can cast those cantrips at will. They don't
            count against your number of cantrips known. If they don't appear on the warlock spell list, they are nonetheless warlock spells for
            you.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you lose your Book of Shadows, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be
            performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous book. The book turns to ash when you die.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Pact of the Talisman</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Your patron gives you an amulet, a talisman that can aid the wearer when the need is great. When the wearer fails an ability check,
            they can add a d4 to the roll, potentially turning the roll into a success. This benefit can be used a number of times equal to your
            proficiency bonus, and all expended uses are restored when you finish a long rest.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you lose the talisman, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed
            during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous amulet. The talisman turns to ash when you die.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Ability Score Improvement</h2>
    <p>
      When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can
      increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.
    </p>

    <h2 id="mystic-arcanum">Mystic Arcanum</h2>
    <p>
      At 11th level, your patron bestows upon you a magical secret called an arcanum. Choose one 6th-level spell from the warlock spell list as
      this arcanum.
    </p>
    <p>You can cast your arcanum spell once without expending a spell slot. You must finish a long rest before you can do so again.</p>
    <p>
      At higher levels, you gain more warlock spells of your choice that can be cast in this way: one 7th-level spell at 13th level, one 8th-level
      spell at 15th level, and one 9th-level spell at 17th level. You regain all uses of your Mystic Arcanum when you finish a long rest.
    </p>

    <h2 id="eldritch-master">Eldritch Master</h2>
    <p>
      At 20th level, you can draw on your inner reserve of mystical power while entreating your patron to regain expended spell slots. You can
      spend 1 minute entreating your patron for aid to regain all your expended spell slots from your Pact Magic feature. Once you regain spell
      slots with this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can do so again.
