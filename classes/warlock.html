    <h1>Class Features</h1>
    <p>As a warlock, you gain the following class features.</p>

    <h3>Hit Points</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Hit Dice:</strong> 1d8 per warlock level<br>
      <strong>Hit Points at 1st Level:</strong> 8 + your Consitution modifier<br>
      <strong>Hit Points at Higher Levels:</strong> 1d8 (or 5) + your Consitution modifier<br>
    </p>
    <h3>Proficiencies</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Armor:</strong> Light armor<br>
      <strong>Weapons:</strong> Simple weapons<br>
      <strong>Tools:</strong> None<br>
      <strong>Saving Throws:</strong>Wisdom, Charisma<br>
      <strong>Skills:</strong> Choose two from Arcana, Deception, History, Intimidation, Investigation, Nature, and Religion
    </p>
    <h3>Equipment</h3>
    <p>You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>(a) a light crossbow and 20 bolts or (b) any simple weapon</li>
      <li>(a) a component pouch or (b) an arcane focus</li>
      <li>(a) a scholar's pack or (b) a dungeoneer's pack</li>
      <li>leather armor, any simple weapon, and two daggers</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="otherworldly-patron">Otherworldly Patron</h2>
    <p>
      At 1st level, you have struck a bargain with an otherworldly being of your choice. Choose <a href="#archfey">Archfey</a>,
      <a href="#celestial">Celestial</a>, <a href="#fathomless">Fathomless</a>, <a href="#fiend">Fiend</a>, <a href="#genie">Genie</a>,
      <a href="#great-old-one">Great Old One</a>, <a href="#hexblade">Hexblade</a>, <a href="#undead">Undead</a>, or
      <a href="#undying">Undying</a>. Your choice grants you features at 1st level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.
    </p>

    <h2 id="pact-magic">Pact Magic</h2>
    <p>Your arcane research and the magic bestowed on you by your patron have given you facility with spells.</p>

    <h3>Cantrips</h3>
    <p>
      You know two cantrips of your choice from the warlock spell list. You learn additional warlock cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as
      shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Warlock table.
    </p>

    <h3>Spell Slots</h3>
    <p>
      The Warlock table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your warlock spells of 1st through 5th level. The table also shows what the
      level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your warlock spells of 1st level or higher, you must
      expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, when you are 5th level, you have two 3rd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell witch bolt, you must spend one of those
      slots, and you cast it as a 3rd-level spell.
    </p>

    <h3>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</h3>
    <p>At 1st level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the warlock spell list.</p>
    <p>
      The Spells Known column of the Warlock table shows when you learn more warlock spells of your choice of 1st level or higher. A spell you
      choose must be of a level no higher than what's shown in the table's Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 6th level, for
      example, you learn a new warlock spell, which can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the warlock spells you know and replace it with another spell from
      the warlock spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
    </p>

    <h3>Spellcasting Ability</h3>
    <p>
      Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your warlock spells, so you use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting
      ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a warlock spell you cast and when making an attack
      roll with one.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Spell save DC =</strong> 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>
    <p><strong>Spell attack modifier =</strong> your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>

    <h3>Spellcasting Focus</h3>
    <p>You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your warlock spells.</p>

    <h2 id="eldritch-invocations">Eldritch Invocations</h2>
    <p>
      In your study of occult lore, you have unearthed <a href="eldritch-invocations.html">Eldritch Invocations</a>, fragments of forbidden
      knowledge that imbue you with an abiding magical ability.
    </p>
    <p>
      At 2nd level, you gain two eldritch invocations of your choice. When you gain certain warlock levels, you gain additional invocations of
      your choice, as shown in the Invocations Known column of the Warlock table. A level prerequisite refers to your level in this class.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the invocations you know and replace it with another invocation
      that you could learn at that level.
    </p>

    <h2>Pact Boon</h2>
    <p>
      At 3rd level, your otherworldly patron bestows a gift upon you for your loyal service. You gain one of the following features of your choice.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Pact of the Blade</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            You can use your action to create a pact weapon in your empty hand. You can choose the form that this melee weapon takes each time you
            create it. You are proficient with it while you wield it. This weapon counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and
            immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.
          </li>
          <li>
            Your pact weapon disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more. It also disappears if you use this feature
            again, if you dismiss the weapon (no action required), or if you die.
          </li>
          <li>
            You can transform one magic weapon into your pact weapon by performing a special ritual while you hold the weapon. You perform the
            ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest.
          </li>
          <li>
            You can then dismiss the weapon, shunting it into an extradimensional space, and it appears whenever you create your pact weapon
            thereafter. You can't affect an artifact or a sentient weapon in this way. The weapon ceases being your pact weapon if you die, if you
            perform the 1-hour ritual on a different weapon, or if you use a 1-hour ritual to break your bond to it. The weapon appears at your
            feet if it is in the extradimensional space when the bond breaks.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Pact of the Chain</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>You learn the find familiar spell and can cast it as a ritual. The spell doesn't count against your number of spells known.</li>
          <li>
            When you cast the spell, you can choose one of the normal forms for your familiar or one of the following special forms: imp,
            pseudodragon, quasit, or sprite.
          </li>
          <li>
            Additionally, when you take the Attack action, you can forgo one of your own attacks to allow your familiar to use its reaction to
            make one attack with its reaction.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Pact of the Tome</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Your patron gives you a grimoire called a Book of Shadows. When you gain this feature, choose three cantrips from any class's spell
            list (the three needn't be from the same list). While the book is on your person, you can cast those cantrips at will. They don't
            count against your number of cantrips known. If they don't appear on the warlock spell list, they are nonetheless warlock spells for
            you.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you lose your Book of Shadows, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be
            performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous book. The book turns to ash when you die.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Pact of the Talisman</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Your patron gives you an amulet, a talisman that can aid the wearer when the need is great. When the wearer fails an ability check,
            they can add a d4 to the roll, potentially turning the roll into a success. This benefit can be used a number of times equal to your
            proficiency bonus, and all expended uses are restored when you finish a long rest.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you lose the talisman, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed
            during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous amulet. The talisman turns to ash when you die.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Ability Score Improvement</h2>
    <p>
      When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can
      increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.
    </p>

    <h2 id="mystic-arcanum">Mystic Arcanum</h2>
    <p>
      At 11th level, your patron bestows upon you a magical secret called an arcanum. Choose one 6th-level spell from the warlock spell list as
      this arcanum.
    </p>
    <p>You can cast your arcanum spell once without expending a spell slot. You must finish a long rest before you can do so again.</p>
    <p>
      At higher levels, you gain more warlock spells of your choice that can be cast in this way: one 7th-level spell at 13th level, one 8th-level
      spell at 15th level, and one 9th-level spell at 17th level. You regain all uses of your Mystic Arcanum when you finish a long rest.
    </p>

    <h2 id="eldritch-master">Eldritch Master</h2>
    <p>
      At 20th level, you can draw on your inner reserve of mystical power while entreating your patron to regain expended spell slots. You can
      spend 1 minute entreating your patron for aid to regain all your expended spell slots from your Pact Magic feature. Once you regain spell
      slots with this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can do so again.
    </p>

    <h1>Otherworldly Patrons</h1>

    <h2 id="archfey">The Archfey</h2>
    <p>
      Your patron is a lord or lady of the fey, a creature of legend who holds secrets that were forgotten before the mortal races were born. This
      being's motivations are often inscrutable, and sometimes whimsical, and might involve a striving for greater magical power or the settling
      of age-old grudges.
    </p>

    <h3>Expanded Spell List</h3>
    <p>
      The Archfey lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock
      spell list for you.
    </p>
    <table class="table table-striped">

    </table>

    <h3>Fey Presence</h3>
    <p>
      Starting at 1st level, your patron bestows upon you the ability to project the beguiling and fearsome presence of the fey. As an action, you
      can cause each creature in a 10-foot cube originating from you to make a Wisdom saving throw against your warlock spell save DC. The
      creatures that fail their saving throws are all charmed or frightened by you (your choice) until the end of your next turn.
    </p>
    <p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>

    <h3>Misty Escape</h3>
    <p>
      Starting at 6th level, you can vanish in a puff of mist in response to harm. When you take damage, you can use your reaction to turn
      invisible and teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. You remain invisible until the start of your next turn or until
      you attack or cast a spell.
    </p>
    <p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>

    <h3>Beguiling Defenses</h3>
    <p>
      Beginning at 10th level, your patron teaches you how to turn the mind-affecting magic of your enemies against them. You are immune to being
      charmed, and when another creature attempts to charm you, you can use your reaction to attempt to turn the charm back on that creature. The
      creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your warlock spell save DC or be charmed by you for 1 minute or until the creature
      takes any damage.
    </p>

    <h3>Dark Delirium</h3>
    <p>
      Starting at 14th level, you can plunge a creature into an illusory realm. As an action, choose a creature that you can see within 60 feet of
      you. It must make a Wisdom saving throw against your warlock spell save DC. On a failed save, it is charmed or frightened by you (your
      choice) for 1 minute or until your concentration is broken (as if you are concentrating on a spell). This effect ends early if the creature
      takes any damage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Until this illusion ends, the creature thinks it is lost in a misty realm, the appearance of which you choose. The creature can see and hear
      only itself, you, and the illusion.
    </p>
    <p>You must finish a short or long rest before you can use this feature again.</p>

    <h2 id="celestial">The Celestial</h2>
    <p>
      Your patron is a powerful being of the Upper Planes. You have bound yourself to an ancient empyrean, solar, kirin, unicorn, or other entity
      that resides in the planes of everlasting bliss. Your pact with that being allows you to experience the barest touch of the holy light that
      illuminates the multiverse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being connected to such power can cause changes to your behavior and beliefs. You might find yourself driven to annihilate the undead, to
      defeat fiends, and to protect the innocent. At times, your heart might also be filled with a longing for the celestial realm of your patron,
      a desire to wander that paradise for the rest of your days. But you know that your mission is among mortals for now and that your pact binds
      you to bring light to the dark places of the world.
    </p>

    <h3>Expanded Spell List</h3>
    <p>
      The Celestial lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock
      spell list for you.
    </p>
    <table class="table table-striped">
      <thead>

        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <h3>Bonus Cantrips</h3>
    <p>
      At 1st level, you learn the Light and Sacred Flame cantrips. They count as warlock cantrips for you, but they don't count against your
      number of cantrips known.
    </p>

    <h3>Healing Light</h3>
    <p>
      At 1st level, you gain the ability to channel celestial energy to heal wounds. You have a pool of d6s that you spend to fuel this healing.
      The number of dice in the pool equals 1 + your warlock level.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a bonus action, you can heal one creature you can see within 60 feet of you, spending dice from the pool. The maximum number of dice you
      can spend at once equals your Charisma modifier (minimum of one die). Roll the dice you spend, add them together, and restore a number of
      hit points equal to the total.
    </p>
    <p>Your pool regains all expended dice when you finish a long rest.</p>

    <h3>Radiant Soul</h3>
    <p>
      Starting at 6th level, your link to the Celestial allows you to serve as a conduit for radiant energy. You have resistance to radiant damage,
      and when you cast a spell that deals radiant or fire damage, you add your Charisma modifier to one radiant or fire damage roll of that spell
      against one of its targets.
    </p>

    <h3>Celestial Resistance</h3>
    <p>
      Starting at 10th level, you gain temporary hit points whenever you finish a short or long rest. These temporary hit points equal your
      warlock level + your Charisma modifier. Additionally, choose up to five creatures you can see at the end of the rest. Those creatures each
      gain temporary hit points equal to half your warlock level + your Charisma modifier.
    </p>

    <h3>Searing Vengeance</h3>
    <p>
      Starting at 14th level, the radiant energy you channel allows you to resist death. When you have to make a death saving throw at the start
      of your turn, you can instead spring back to your feet with a burst of radiant energy. You regain hit points equal to half your hit point
      maximum, and then you stand up if you so choose. Each creature of your choice that is within 30 feet of you takes radiant damage equal to
      2d8 + your Charisma modifier, and is blinded until the end of the current turn.
    </p>
    <p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>
