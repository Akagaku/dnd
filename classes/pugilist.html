      At 1st level, your years of fighting in back alleys and taverns have given you mastery over combat styles that use unarmed strikes and pugilist weapons, which are simple melee weapons without the two-handed property, whips, and improvised weapons. You can't use the finesse property of a weapon while using it as a pugilist weapon.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        You can roll a d6 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike or pugilist weapon. This die changes as you gain pugilist levels, as shown in the Fisticuffs column on the Pugilist table.
      </li>
      <li>
        When you use the Attack action on your turn and make only unarmed strikes, attacks with pugilist weapons, shove, or grapples, you can use a bonus action to make one grapple or unarmed strike.

Your pugilist level determines the maximum number of points you have, as shown in the Moxie Points column of the Pugilist table.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can spend these points to fuel various moxie features. You start knowing three such moxie features: Brace Up, The Old One-Two, and Stick and Move. You learn more moxie features as you gain levels in this class. You regain all expended moxie points when you finish a short or long rest.
