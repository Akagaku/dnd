    <h1>Bard</h1>
    <p>
      Whether scholar, skald, or scoundrel, a bard weaves magic through words and music to inspire allies, demoralize foes, manipulate minds,
      create illusions, and even heal wounds. The bard is a master of song, speech, and the magic they contain.
    </p>

    <h2 id="spellcasting">Spellcasting</h2>
    <p>
      You have learned to untangle and reshape the fabric of reality in harmony with your wishes and music. Your spells are part of your vast
      repertoire, magic that you can tune to different situations.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Cantrips</h3>
    <p>
      You know two cantrips of your choice from the bard spell list. You learn additional bard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown
      in the Cantrips Known column of the Bard table.
    </p>

    <h3>Spell Slots</h3>
    <p>
      The Bard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your bard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must
      expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. For example, if you know the
      1st-level spell Cure Wounds and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast Cure Wounds using either slot.
    </p>

    <h3>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</h3>
    <p>You know four 1st-level spells of your choice from the bard spell list.</p>
    <p>
      The Spells Known column of the Bard table shows when you learn more bard spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for
      which you have spell slots, as shown on the table. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st
      or 2nd level.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the bard spells you know and replace it with another spell from the
      bard spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
    </p>

    <h3>Spellcasting Ability</h3>
    <p>
      Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your bard spells. Your magic comes from the heart and soul you pour into the performance of your
      music or oration. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier
      when setting the saving throw DC for a bard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Spell save DC =</strong> 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>
    <p><strong>Spell attack modifier =</strong> your proficiency bonus + Charisma modifier</p>

    <h3>Ritual Casting</h3>
    <p>You can cast any bard spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag.</p>

    <h3>Spellcasting Focus</h3>
    <p>You can use a musical instrument as a spellcasting focus for your bard spells.</p>

    <h2 id="bardic-inspiration">Bardic Inspiration</h2>
    <p>
      You can inspire others through stirring words or music. To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature other than
      yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains one Bardic Inspiration die, a d6.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw
      it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide before the
      DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Bardic Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Bardic
      Inspiration die at a time.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish
      a long rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach certain levels in this class. The die becomes a d8 at 5th level, a d10 at 10th level, and
      a d12 at 15th level.
    </p>

    <h2 id="jack-of-all-trades">Jack of All Trades</h2>
    <p>
      Starting at 2nd level, you can add half your proficiency bonus, rounded down, to any ability check you make that doesn't already include your
      proficiency bonus.
    </p>

    <h2 id="song-of-rest">Song of Rest</h2>
    <p>
      Beginning at 2nd level, you can use soothing music or oration to help revitalize your wounded allies during a short rest. If you or any
      friendly creatures who can hear your performance regain hit points at the end of the short rest by spending one or more Hit Dice, each of
      those creatures regains an extra 1d6 hit points.
    </p>
    <p>
      The extra Hit Points increase when you reach certain levels in this class: to 1d8 at 9th level, to 1d10 at 13th level, and to 1d12 at 17th
      level.
    </p>

    <h2 id="bard-college">Bard College</h2>
    <p>
      At 3rd level, you delve into the advanced techniques of a bard college of your choice. Choose <a href="#creation">Creation</a>,
      <a href="#eloquence">Eloquence</a>, <a href="#glamour">Glamour</a>, <a href="#lore">Lore</a>, <a href="#spirits">Spirits</a>,

      and again at 6th and 14th level.
    </p>

    <h2 id="expertise"></h2>
    <p>
      At 3rd level, choose two of your skill proficiencies. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of
      the chosen proficiencies.
    </p>
    <p>At 10th level, you can choose another two skill proficiencies to gain this benefit.</p>

    <h2>Ability Score Improvement</h2>
    <p>
      When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can
      increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.
    </p>

    <h2 id="font-of-inspiration">Font of Inspiration</h2>
    <p>Beginning when you reach 5th level, you regain all of your expended uses of Bardic Inspiration when you finish a short or long rest.</p>

    <h2 id="countercharm">Countercharm</h2>
    <p>
      At 6th level, you gain the ability to use musical notes or words of power to disrupt mind-influencing effects. As an action, you can start a
      performance that lasts until the end of your next turn. During that time, you and any friendly creatures within 30 feet of you have advantage
      on saving throws against being frightened or charmed. A creature must be able to hear you to gain this benefit. The performance ends early if
      you are incapacitated or silenced or if you voluntarily end it (no action required).
    </p>

    <h2 id="magical-secrets">Magical Secrets</h2>
    <p>
      By 10th level, you have plundered magical knowledge from a wide spectrum of disciplines. Choose two spells from any classes, including this
      one. A spell you choose must be of a level you can cast, as shown on the Bard table, or a cantrip.
    </p>
    <p>The chosen spells count as bard spells for you and are included in the number in the Spells Known column of the Bard table.</p>
    <p>You learn two additional spells from any classes at 14th level and again at 18th level.</p>

    <h2 id="superior-inspiration">Superior Inspiration</h2>
    <p>At 20th level, when you roll initiative and have no uses of Bardic Inspiration left, you regain one use.</p>

    <h1>Bard Colleges</h1>

    <h2 id="creation">Creation</h2>
    <p>
      Bards believe the cosmos is a work of art - the creation of the first dragons and gods. That creative work included harmonies that continue
      to resound through existence today, a power known as the Song of Creation. The bards of the College of Creation draw on that primeval song
      through dance, music, and poetry, and their teachers share this lesson: "Before the sun and the moon, there was the Song, and its music awoke
      the first dawn. Its melodies so delighted the stones and trees that some of them gained a voice of their own. And now they sing too. Learn
      the Song, students, and you too can teach the mountains to sing and dance."
    </p>

    <h3>Note of Potential</h3>
    <p>
      When you join the College of Creation at 3rd level, whenever you give a creature a Bardic Inspiration die, you can utter a note from the Song
      of Creation to create a Tiny mote of potential, which orbits within 5 feet of that creature. The mote is intangible and invulnerable, and it
      lasts until the Bardic Inspiration die is lost. The mote looks like a musical note, a star, a flower, or another symbol of art or life that
      you choose.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the creature uses the Bardic Inspiration die, the mote provides an additional effect based on whether the die benefits an ability check,
      an attack roll, or a saving throw, as detailed below:
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Ability Check.</strong> When the creature rolls the Bardic Inspiration die to add it to an ability check, the creature can roll the
      Bardic Inspiration die again and choose which roll to use, as the mote pops and emits colorful, harmless sparks for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Attack Roll.</strong> Immediately after the creature rolls the Bardic Inspiration die to add it to an attack roll against a target,
      the mote thunderously shatters. The target and each creature of your choice that you can see within 5 feet of it must succeed on a
      Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or take thunder damage equal to the number rolled on the Bardic Inspiration die.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Saving Throw.</strong> Immediately after the creature rolls the Bardic Inspiration die and adds it to a saving throw, the mote
      vanishes with the sound of soft music, causing the creature to gain temporary hit points equal to the number rolled on the Bardic Inspiration
      die plus your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1 temporary hit point).
    </p>

    <h3>Performance of Creation</h3>
    <p>
      Also at 3rd level, as an action, you can channel the magic of the Song of Creation to create one nonmagical item of your choice in an
      unoccupied space within 10 feet of you. The item must appear on a surface or in a liquid that can support it. The gp value of the item can't
      be more than 20 times your bard level, and the item must be Medium or smaller. The item glimmers softly, and a creature can faintly hear
      music when touching it. The created item disappears after a number of hours equal to your proficiency bonus. For examples of items you can
      create, see the equipment chapter of the Player's Handbook.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you create an item with this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a spell slot of 2nd level
      or higher to use this feature again. You can have only one item created by this feature at a time; if you use this action and already have an
      item from this feature, the first one immediately vanishes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The size of the item you can create with this feature increases by one size category when you reach 6th level (Large) and 14th level (Huge).
    </p>

    <h3>Animating Performance</h3>
    <p>
      By 6th level, as an action, you can target a Large or smaller nonmagical item you can see within 30 feet of you and animate it. The animate
      item uses the Dancing Item stat block, which uses your proficiency bonus (PB), The item is friendly to you and your companions and obeys your
      commands. It lives for 1 hour, until it is reduced to 0 hit points, or until you die.
    </p>
    <p>
      In combat, the item shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It can move and use its reaction on its own,
      but the only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take another
      action. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. If you are incapacitated, the item can take any action of its choice,
      not just Dodge.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you use your Bardic Inspiration feature, you can command the item as part of the same bonus action you use for Bardic Inspiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you animate an item with this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a spell slot of 3rd level
      or higher to use this feature again. You can have only one item animated by this feature at a time; if you use this action and already have
      a dancing item from this feature, the first one immediately becomes inanimate.

    <h3>Creative Crescendo</h3>
    <p>
      At 14th level, when you use your Performance of Creation feature, you can create more than one item at once. The number of items equals your
      Charisma modifier (minimum of two items). If you create an item that would exceed that number, you choose which of the previously created
      items disappears. Only one of these items can be of the maximum size you can create; the rest must be Small or Tiny.
    </p>
    <p>You are no longer limited by gp value when creating items with Performance of Creation.</p>

    <h2 id="eloquence">Eloquence</h2>
    <p>
      Adherents of the College of Eloquence master the art of oratory. Persuasion is regarded as a high art, and a well-reasoned, well-spoken
      argument often proves more powerful than objective truth. These bards wield a blend of logic and theatrical wordplay, winning over skeptics
      and detractors with logical arguments, and plucking at heartstrings to appeal to the emotions of entire audiences.
    </p>

    <h3>Silver Tongue</h3>
    <p>
      Starting at 3rd level, you are a master at saying the right thing at the right time. When you make a Charisma (Persuasion) or Charisma
      (Deception) check, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.
    </p>

    <h3>Unsettling Words</h3>
    <p>
      Also at 3rd level, you can spin words laced with magic that unsettle a creature and cause it to doubt itself. As a bonus action, you can
      expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration and choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. Roll the Bardic Inspiration die. The
      creature must subtract the number rolled from the next saving throw it makes before the start of your next turn.
    </p>

    <h3>Unfailing Inspiration</h3>
    <p>
      At 6th level, your inspiring words are so persuasive that others feel driven to succeed. When a creature adds one of your Bardic Inspiration
      dice to its ability check, attack roll, or saving throw and the roll fails, the creature can keep the Bardic Inspiration die.
    </p>

    <h3>Universal Speech</h3>
    <p>
      Also at 6th level, you have gained the ability to make your speech intelligible to any creature. As an action, choose one or more creatures
      within 60 feet of you, up to a number equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature). The chosen creatures can magically
      understand you, regardless of the language you speak, for 1 hour.
    </p>
    <p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a spell slot to use it again.</p>

    <h3>Infectious Inspiration</h3>
    <p>
      At 14th level, when you successfully inspire someone, the power of your eloquence can now spread to someone else. When a creature within 60
      feet of you adds one of your Bardic Inspiration dice to its ability check, attack roll, or saving throw and the roll succeeds, you can use
      your reaction to encourage a different creature (other than yourself) that can hear you within 60 feet of you, giving it a Bardic Inspiration
      die without expending any of your Bardic Inspiration uses.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can use this reaction a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you
      finish a long rest.
    </p>

    <h2 id="glamour">Glamour</h2>
    <p>
      The College of Glamour is the home of bards who mastered their craft in the vibrant realm of the Feywild or under the tutelage of someone
      who dwelled there. Tutored by satyrs, eladrin, and other fey, these bards learn to use their magic to delight and captivate others.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bards of this college are regarded with a mixture of awe and fear. Their performances are the stuff of legend. These bards are so
      eloquent that a speech or song that one of them performs can cause captors to release the bard unharmed and can lull a furious dragon into
      complacency. The same magic that allows them to quell beasts can also bend minds. Villainous bards of this college can leech off a community
      for weeks, abusing their magic to turn their hosts into thralls. Heroic bards of this college instead use this power to gladden the
      downtrodden and undermine oppressors.
    </p>

    <h3>Mantle of Inspiration</h3>
    <p>
      When you join the College of Glamour at 3rd level, you gain the ability to weave a song of fey magic that imbues your allies with vigor and
      speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a bonus action, you can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to grant yourself a wondrous appearance. When you do so, choose a number
      of creatures you can see and who can see you within 60 feet of you, up to a number equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one). Each of
      them gains 5 temporary hit points. When a creature gains these temporary hit points, it can immediately use its reaction to move up to its
      speed, without provoking opportunity attacks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The number of temporary hit points increases when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to 8 at 5th level, 11 at 10th level,
      and 14 at 15th level.
    </p>

    <h3>Enthralling Performance</h3>
    <p>Starting at 3rd level, you can charge your performance with seductive, fey magic.</p>
    <p>
      If you perform for at least 1 minute, you can attempt to inspire wonder in your audience by singing, reciting a poem, or dancing. At the end
      of the performance, choose a number of humanoids within 60 feet of you who watched and listened to all of it, up to a number equal to your
      Charisma modifier (minimum of one). Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or be charmed by you. While
      charmed in this way, the target idolizes you, it speaks glowingly of you to anyone who speaks to it, and it hinders anyone who opposes you,
      avoiding violence unless it was already inclined to fight on your behalf. This effect ends on a target after 1 hour, if it takes any damage,
      if you attack it, or if it witnesses you attacking or damaging any of its allies.
    </p>
    <p>If a target succeeds on its saving throw, the target has no hint that you tried to charm it.</p>
    <p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>

    <h3>Mantle of Majesty</h3>
    <p>
      At 6th level, you gain the ability to cloak yourself in a fey magic that makes others want to serve you. As a bonus action, you cast
      Command, without expending a spell slot, and you take on an appearance of unearthly beauty for 1 minute or until your concentration ends (as
      if you were concentrating on a spell). During this time, you can cast Command as a bonus action on each of your turns, without expending a
      spell slot.
    </p>
    <p>Any creature charmed by you automatically fails its saving throw against the Command you cast with this feature.</p>
    <p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>

    <h3>Unbreakable Majesty</h3>
    <p>At 14th level, your appearance permanently gains an otherworldly aspect that makes you look more lovely and fierce.</p>
    <p>
      In addition, as a bonus action, you can assume a magically majestic presence for 1 minute or until you are incapacitated. For the duration,
      whenever any creature tries to attack you for the first time on a turn, the attacker must make a Charisma saving throw against your spell
      save DC. On a failed save, it can't attack you on this turn, and it must choose a new target for its attack or the attack is wasted. On a
      successful save, it can attack you on this turn, but it has disadvantage on any saving throw it makes against your spells on your next turn.
    </p>
    <p>Once you assume this majestic presence, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>

    <h2 id="lore">Lore</h2>
    <p>
      Bards of the College of Lore know something about most things, collecting bits of knowledge from sources as diverse as scholarly tomes and
      peasant tales. Whether singing folk ballads in taverns or elaborate compositions in royal courts, these bards use their gifts to hold
      audiences spellbound. When the applause dies down, the audience members might find themselves questioning everything they held to be true,
      from their faith in the priesthood of the local temple to their loyalty to the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      The loyalty of these bards lies in the pursuit of beauty and truth, not in fealty to a monarch or following the tenets of a deity. A noble
      who keeps such a bard as a herald or advisor knows that the bard would rather be honest than politic.
    </p>
    <p>
      The college's members gather in libraries and sometimes in actual colleges, complete with classrooms and dormitories, to share their lore
      with one another. They also meet at festivals or affairs of state, where they can expose corruption, unravel lies, and poke fun at
      self-important figures of authority.
    </p>

    <h3>Bonus Proficiency</h3>
    <p>When you join the College of Lore at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with three skills of your choice.</p>

    <h3>Cutting Words</h3>
    <p>
      Also at 3rd level, you learn how to use your wit to distract, confuse, and otherwise sap the confidence and competence of others. When a
      creature that you can see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a damage roll, you can use your reaction to
      expend one of your uses of Bardic Inspiration, rolling a Bardic Inspiration die and subtracting the number rolled from the creature's roll.
      You can choose to use this feature after the creature makes its roll, but before the DM determines whether the attack roll or ability check
      succeeds or fails, or before the creature deals its damage. The creature is immune if it can't hear you or if it's immune to being charmed.
    </p>

    <h3>Additional Secrets</h3>
    <p>
      At 6th level, you learn two spells of your choice from any class. A spell you choose must be of a level you can cast, as shown on the Bard
      table, or a cantrip. The chosen spells count as bard spells for you but don't count against the number of bard spells you know.
    </p>

    <h3>Peerless Skill</h3>
    <p>
      Starting at 14th level, when you make an ability check, you can expend one use of Bardic Inspiration. Roll a Bardic Inspiration die and add
      the number rolled to your ability check. You can choose to do so after you roll the die for the ability check, but before the DM tells you
      whether you succeed or fail.
    </p>

    <h2 id="spirits">Spirits</h2>
    <p>
      Bards of the College of Spirits seek tales with inherent power-be they legends, histories, or fictions-and bring their subjects to life.
      Using occult trappings, these bards conjure spiritual embodiments of powerful forces to change the world once more. Such spirits are
      capricious, though, and what a bard summons isn't always entirely under their control.
    </p>

    <h3>Guiding Whispers</h3>
    <p>
      At 3rd level, you can reach out to spirits to guide you and others. You learn the Guidance cantrip, which doesn't count against the number
      of bard cantrips you know. For you, it has a range of 60 feet when you cast it.
    </p>

    <h3>Spiritual Focus</h3>
    <p>
      At 3rd level, you employ tools that aid you in channeling spirits, be they historical figures or fictional archetypes. You can use the
      following objects as a spellcasting focus for your bard spells: a candle, crystal ball, skull, spirit board, or tarot deck.
    </p>
    <p>
      Starting at 6th level, when you cast a bard spell that deals damage or restores hit points through the Spiritual Focus, roll a d6, and you
      gain a bonus to one damage or healing roll of the spell equal to the number rolled.
    </p>

    <h3>Tales from Beyond</h3>
    <p>
      At 3rd level, you reach out to spirits who tell their tales through you. While you are holding your Spiritual Focus, you can use a bonus
      action to expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration and roll on the Spirit Tales table using your Bardic Inspiration die to determine the
      tale the spirits direct you to tell. You retain the tale in mind until you bestow the tale's effect or you finish a short or long rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can use an action to choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you (this can be you) to be the target of the tale's effect. Once
      you do so, you can't bestow the tale's effect again until you roll it again.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can retain only one of these tales in mind at a time, and rolling on the Spirit Tales table immediately ends the effect of the previous
      tale.
    </p>
    <p>If the tale requires a saving throw, the DC equals your spell save DC.</p>

    <h3>Spirit Sessions</h3>
    <p>
      At 6th level, spirits provide you with supernatural insights. You can conduct an hour-long ritual channeling spirits (which can be done
      during a short or long rest) using your Spiritual Focus. You can conduct the ritual with a number of willing creatures equal to your
      proficiency bonus (including yourself). At the end of the ritual, you temporarily learn one spell of your choice from any class.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spell you choose must be of a level equal to the number of creatures that conducted the ritual or less, the spell must of a level you
      can cast, and it must be in the school of Divination or Necromancy. The chosen spell counts as a bard spell for you but doesn't count
      against the number of bard spells you know.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you perform the ritual, you can't do so again until you start a long rest, and you know the chosen spell until you start a long rest.
    </p>

    <h3>Mystical Connection</h3>
    <p>
      At 14th level, you now have the ability to nudge the spirits of Tales from Beyond toward certain tales. Whenever you roll on the Spirit
      Tales table, you can roll the die twice and choose which of the two effects to bestow. If you roll the same number on both dice, you can
      ignore the number and choose any effect on the table.
    </p>

    <h2 id="swords">Swords</h2>
    <p>
      Working on it. No info available for free online, so I'll have to transcribe this one by hand.
    </p>

    <h2 id="valor">Valor</h2>
    <p>
      Bards of the College of Valor are daring skalds whose tales keep alive the memory of the great heroes of the past, and thereby inspire a
      new generation of heroes. These bards gather in mead halls or around great bonfires to sing the deeds of the mighty, both past and present.
      They travel the land to witness great events firsthand and to ensure that the memory of those events doesn't pass from the world. With
      their songs, they inspire others to reach the same heights of accomplishment as the heroes of old.
    </p>

    <h3>Bonus Proficiencies</h3>
    <p>When you join the College of Valor at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with medium armor, shields, and martial weapons.</p>

    <h3>Combat Inspiration</h3>
    <p>
      Also at 3rd level, you learn to inspire others in battle. A creature that has a Bardic Inspiration die from you can roll that die and add
      the number rolled to a weapon damage roll it just made. Alternatively, when an attack roll is made against the creature, it can use its
      reaction to roll the Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to its AC against that attack, after seeing the roll but before
      knowing whether it hits or misses.
    </p>

    <h3>Extra Attack</h3>
    <p>Starting at 6th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p>

    <h3>Battle Magic</h3>
    <p>
      At 14th level, you have mastered the art of weaving spellcasting and weapon use into a single harmonious act. When you use your action to
      cast a bard spell, you can make one weapon attack as a bonus action.
    </p>

    <h2 id="whispers">Whispers</h2>
    <p>
      Most folk are happy to welcome a bard into their midst. Bards of the College of Whispers use this to their advantage. They appear to be
      like any other bard, sharing news, singing songs, and telling tales to the audiences they gather. In truth, the College of Whispers teaches
      its students that they are wolves among sheep. These bards use their knowledge and magic to uncover secrets and turn them against others
      through extortion and threats.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many other bards hate the College of Whispers, viewing it as a parasite that uses the bards' reputation to acquire wealth and power. For
      this reason, these bards rarely reveal their true nature unless they must. They typically claim to follow some other college, or keep their
      true nature secret in order to better infiltrate and exploit royal courts and other settings of power.
    </p>

    <h3>Psychic Blades</h3>
    <p>
      When you join the College of Whispers at 3rd level, you gain the ability to make your weapon attacks magically toxic to a creature's mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to deal an additional 2d6 psychic damage to
      that target. You can do so only once per round on your turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      The psychic damage increases when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to 3d6 at 5th level, 5d6 at 10th level, and 8d6 at
      15th level.
    </p>

    <h3>Words of Terror</h3>
    <p>At 3rd level, you learn to infuse innocent-seeming words with an insidious magic that can inspire terror.</p>
    <p>
      If you speak to a humanoid alone for at least 1 minute, you can attempt to seed paranoia and fear into its mind. At the end of the
      conversation, the target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or be frightened of you or another creature of
      your choice. The target is frightened in this way for 1 hour, until it is attacked or damaged, or until it witnesses its allies being
      attacked or damaged.
    </p>
    <p>If the target succeeds on its saving throw, the target has no hint that you tried to frighten it.</p>
    <p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short rest or long rest.</p>

    <h3>Mantle of Whispers</h3>
    <p>
      At 6th level, you gain the ability to adopt a humanoid's persona. When a humanoid dies within 30 feet of you, you can magically capture its
      shadow using your reaction. You retain this shadow until you use it or you finish a long rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can use the shadow as an action. When you do so, it vanishes, magically transforming into a disguise that appears on you. You now look
      like the dead person, but healthy and alive. This disguise lasts for 1 hour or until you end it as a bonus action.
    </p>
    <p>
      While you're in the disguise, you gain access to all information that the humanoid would freely share with a casual acquaintance. Such
      information includes general details on its background and personal life, but doesn't include secrets. The information is enough that you
      can pass yourself off as the person by drawing on its memories.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another creature can see through this disguise by succeeding on a Wisdom (Insight) check contested by your Charisma (Deception) check. You
      gain a +5 bonus to your check.
    </p>
    <p>Once you capture a shadow with this feature, you can't capture another one with it until you finish a short or long rest.</p>

    <h3>Shadow Lore</h3>
    <p>At 14th level, you gain the ability to weave dark magic into your words and tap into a creature's deepest fears.</p>
    <p>
      As an action, you magically whisper a phrase that only one creature of your choice within 30 feet of you can hear. The target must make a
      Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. It automatically succeeds if it doesn't share a language with you or if it can't hear you.
      On a successful saving throw, your whisper sounds like unintelligible mumbling and has no effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the target fails its saving throw, it is charmed by you for the next 8 hours or until you or your allies attack or damage it. It
      interprets the whispers as a description of its most mortifying secret.
    </p>
    <p>
      While you gain no knowledge of this secret, the target is convinced you know it. While charmed in this way, the creature obeys your
      commands for fear that you will reveal its secret. It won't risk its life for you or fight for you, unless it was already inclined to do
      so. It grants you favors and gifts it would offer to a close friend.
    </p>
    <p>When the effect ends, the creature has no understanding of why it held you in such fear.</p>
    <p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>
