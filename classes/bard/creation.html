    <h1>Bard: College of Creation</h1>
    <p>
      Bards believe the cosmos is a work of art - the creation of the first dragons and gods. That creative work included harmonies that continue
      to resound through existence today, a power known as the Song of Creation. The bards of the College of Creation draw on that primeval song
      through dance, music, and poetry, and their teachers share this lesson: "Before the sun and the moon, there was the Song, and its music awoke
      the first dawn. Its melodies so delighted the stones and trees that some of them gained a voice of their own. And now they sing too. Learn
      the Song, students, and you too can teach the mountains to sing and dance."
    </p>

    <h2>Note of Potential</h2>
    <p>
      When you join the College of Creation at 3rd level, whenever you give a creature a Bardic Inspiration die, you can utter a note from the Song
      of Creation to create a Tiny mote of potential, which orbits within 5 feet of that creature. The mote is intangible and invulnerable, and it
      lasts until the Bardic Inspiration die is lost. The mote looks like a musical note, a star, a flower, or another symbol of art or life that
      you choose.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the creature uses the Bardic Inspiration die, the mote provides an additional effect based on whether the die benefits an ability check,
      an attack roll, or a saving throw, as detailed below:
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Ability Check.</strong> When the creature rolls the Bardic Inspiration die to add it to an ability check, the creature can roll the
      Bardic Inspiration die again and choose which roll to use, as the mote pops and emits colorful, harmless sparks for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Attack Roll.</strong> Immediately after the creature rolls the Bardic Inspiration die to add it to an attack roll against a target,
      the mote thunderously shatters. The target and each creature of your choice that you can see within 5 feet of it must succeed on a
      Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or take thunder damage equal to the number rolled on the Bardic Inspiration die.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Saving Throw.</strong> Immediately after the creature rolls the Bardic Inspiration die and adds it to a saving throw, the mote
      vanishes with the sound of soft music, causing the creature to gain temporary hit points equal to the number rolled on the Bardic Inspiration
      die plus your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1 temporary hit point).
    </p>

    <h2>Performance of Creation</h2>
    <p>
      Also at 3rd level, as an action, you can channel the magic of the Song of Creation to create one nonmagical item of your choice in an
      unoccupied space within 10 feet of you. The item must appear on a surface or in a liquid that can support it. The gp value of the item can't
      be more than 20 times your bard level, and the item must be Medium or smaller. The item glimmers softly, and a creature can faintly hear
      music when touching it. The created item disappears after a number of hours equal to your proficiency bonus. For examples of items you can
      create, see the equipment chapter of the Player's Handbook.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you create an item with this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a spell slot of 2nd level
      or higher to use this feature again. You can have only one item created by this feature at a time; if you use this action and already have an
      item from this feature, the first one immediately vanishes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The size of the item you can create with this feature increases by one size category when you reach 6th level (Large) and 14th level (Huge).
    </p>

    <h2>Animating Performance</h2>
    <p>
      By 6th level, as an action, you can target a Large or smaller nonmagical item you can see within 30 feet of you and animate it. The animate
      item uses the Dancing Item stat block, which uses your proficiency bonus (PB), The item is friendly to you and your companions and obeys your
      commands. It lives for 1 hour, until it is reduced to 0 hit points, or until you die.
    </p>
    <p>
      In combat, the item shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It can move and use its reaction on its own,
      but the only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take another
      action. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. If you are incapacitated, the item can take any action of its choice,
      not just Dodge.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you use your Bardic Inspiration feature, you can command the item as part of the same bonus action you use for Bardic Inspiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you animate an item with this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a spell slot of 3rd level
      or higher to use this feature again. You can have only one item animated by this feature at a time; if you use this action and already have
      a dancing item from this feature, the first one immediately becomes inanimate.

    <h2>Creative Crescendo</h2>
    <p>
      At 14th level, when you use your Performance of Creation feature, you can create more than one item at once. The number of items equals your
      Charisma modifier (minimum of two items). If you create an item that would exceed that number, you choose which of the previously created
      items disappears. Only one of these items can be of the maximum size you can create; the rest must be Small or Tiny.
    </p>
    <p>You are no longer limited by gp value when creating items with Performance of Creation.</p>
