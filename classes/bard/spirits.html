    <h1>Bard: College of Spirits</h1>
    <p>
      Bards of the College of Spirits seek tales with inherent power-be they legends, histories, or fictions-and bring their subjects to life.
      Using occult trappings, these bards conjure spiritual embodiments of powerful forces to change the world once more. Such spirits are
      capricious, though, and what a bard summons isn't always entirely under their control.
    </p>

    <h2>Guiding Whispers</h2>
    <p>
      At 3rd level, you can reach out to spirits to guide you and others. You learn the Guidance cantrip, which doesn't count against the number
      of bard cantrips you know. For you, it has a range of 60 feet when you cast it.
    </p>

    <h2>Spiritual Focus</h2>
    <p>
      At 3rd level, you employ tools that aid you in channeling spirits, be they historical figures or fictional archetypes. You can use the
      following objects as a spellcasting focus for your bard spells: a candle, crystal ball, skull, spirit board, or tarot deck.
    </p>
    <p>
      Starting at 6th level, when you cast a bard spell that deals damage or restores hit points through the Spiritual Focus, roll a d6, and you
      gain a bonus to one damage or healing roll of the spell equal to the number rolled.
    </p>

    <h2>Tales from Beyond</h2>
    <p>
      At 3rd level, you reach out to spirits who tell their tales through you. While you are holding your Spiritual Focus, you can use a bonus
      action to expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration and roll on the Spirit Tales table using your Bardic Inspiration die to determine the
      tale the spirits direct you to tell. You retain the tale in mind until you bestow the tale's effect or you finish a short or long rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can use an action to choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you (this can be you) to be the target of the tale's effect. Once
      you do so, you can't bestow the tale's effect again until you roll it again.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can retain only one of these tales in mind at a time, and rolling on the Spirit Tales table immediately ends the effect of the previous
      tale.
    </p>
    <p>If the tale requires a saving throw, the DC equals your spell save DC.</p>

            extra die is the same type as your Bardic Inspiration die.

    <h2>Spirit Sessions</h2>
    <p>
      At 6th level, spirits provide you with supernatural insights. You can conduct an hour-long ritual channeling spirits (which can be done
      during a short or long rest) using your Spiritual Focus. You can conduct the ritual with a number of willing creatures equal to your
      proficiency bonus (including yourself). At the end of the ritual, you temporarily learn one spell of your choice from any class.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spell you choose must be of a level equal to the number of creatures that conducted the ritual or less, the spell must of a level you
      can cast, and it must be in the school of Divination or Necromancy. The chosen spell counts as a bard spell for you but doesn't count
      against the number of bard spells you know.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you perform the ritual, you can't do so again until you start a long rest, and you know the chosen spell until you start a long rest.
    </p>

    <h2>Mystical Connection</h2>
    <p>
      At 14th level, you now have the ability to nudge the spirits of Tales from Beyond toward certain tales. Whenever you roll on the Spirit
      Tales table, you can roll the die twice and choose which of the two effects to bestow. If you roll the same number on both dice, you can
      ignore the number and choose any effect on the table.
