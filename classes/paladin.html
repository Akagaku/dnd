    <h1>Class Features</h1>
    <p>As a paladin, you gain the following class features.</p>

    <h3>Hit Points</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Hit Dice:</strong> 1d10 per paladin level<br>
      <strong>Hit Points at 1st Level:</strong> 10 + your Constitution modifier<br>
      <strong>Hit Points at Higher Levels:</strong> 1d10 (or 6) + your Constitution modifier<br>
    </p>
    <h3>Proficiencies</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Armor:</strong> All armor, shields<br>
      <strong>Weapons:</strong> Simple weapons, martial weapons<br>
      <strong>Tools:</strong> None<br>
      <strong>Saving Throws:</strong> Wisdom, Charisma<br>
      <strong>Skills:</strong> Choose two from Athletics, Insight, Intimidation, Medicine, Persuasion, and Religion
    </p>
    <h3>Equipment</h3>
    <p>You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>(a) a martial weapon and a shield or (b) two martial weapons</li>
      <li>(a) five javelins or (b) any simple melee weapon</li>
      <li>(a) a priest's pack or (b) an explorer's pack</li>
      <li>Chain mail and a holy symbol</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="divine-sense">Divine Sense</h2>
    <p>
      The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a noxious odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly music in your ears. As an
      action, you can open your awareness to detect such forces. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any celestial, fiend,
      or undead within 60 feet of you that is not behind total cover. You know the type (celestial, fiend, or undead) of any being whose presence
      you sense, but not its identity (the vampire Count Strahd von Zarovich, for instance). Within the same radius, you also detect the presence
      of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the Hallow spell.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier. When you finish a long rest, you regain all expended uses.
    </p>

    <h2 id="lay-on-hands">Lay on Hands</h2>
    <p>
      Your blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool of healing power that replenishes when you take a long rest. With that pool, you can
      restore a total number of hit points equal to your paladin level x 5.
    </p>
    <p>
      As an action, you can touch a creature and draw power from the pool to restore a number of hit points to that creature, up to the maximum
      amount remaining in your pool.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from your pool of healing to cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting
      it. You can cure multiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single use of Lay on Hands, expending hit points separately for
      each one.
    </p>
    <p>This feature has no effect on undead and constructs.</p>

    <h2 id="fighting-style">Fighting Style</h2>
    <p>
      You adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more
      than once, even if you later get to choose again.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Archery.</strong> You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Blind Fighting.</strong> You have blindsight with a range of 10 feet. Within that range, you can effectively see anything that
        isn't behind total cover, even if you're blinded or in darkness. Moreover, you can see an invisible creature within that range, unless the
        creature successfully hides from you.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Defense.</strong> While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Dueling.</strong> When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with
        that weapon.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Great Weapon Fighting.</strong> When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are
        wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the
        two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Interception.</strong> When a creature you can see hits a target, other than you, within 5 feet of you with an attack, you can use
        your reaction to reduce the damage the target takes by 1d10 + your proficiency bonus (to a minimum of 0 damage). You must be wielding a
        shield or a simple or martial weapon to use this reaction.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Protection.</strong> When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your
        reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Superior Technique.</strong> You learn one maneuver of your choice from among those available to the Battle Master archetype. If a
        maneuver you use requires your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver's effects, the saving throw DC equals 8 + your
        proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice).
        <ul>
          <li>
            You gain one superiority die, which is a d6 (this die is added to any superiority dice you have from another source). This die is used
            to fuel your maneuvers. A superiority die is expended when you use it. You regain your expended superiority dice when you finish a
            short or long rest.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Thrown Weapon Fighting.</strong> You can draw a weapon that has the thrown property as part of the attack you make with the weapon.
        <ul>
          <li>In addition, when you hit with a ranged attack using a thrown weapon, you gain a +2 bonus to the damage roll.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Two-Weapon Fighting.</strong> When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the
        second attack.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Unarmed Fighting.</strong> Your unarmed strikes can deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier on a hit. If you
        aren't wielding any weapons or a shield when you make the attack roll, the d6 becomes a d8.
        <ul>
          <li>At the start of each of your turns, you can deal 1d4 bludgeoning damage to one creature grappled by you.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="spellcasting">Spellcasting</h2>
    <p>By 2nd level, you have learned to draw on divine magic through meditation and prayer to cast spells as a cleric does.</p>

    <h3>Preparing and Casting Spells</h3>
    <p>
      The Paladin table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your paladin spells. To cast one of your paladin spells of 1st level or higher,
      you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      You prepare the list of paladin spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the paladin spell list. When you do so, choose a
      number of paladin spells equal to your Charisma modifier + half your paladin level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be
      of a level for which you have spell slots.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, if you are a 5th-level paladin, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Charisma of 14, your list of
      prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell Cure Wounds, you can
      cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of paladin spells requires time spent in
      prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.
    </p>

    <h3>Spellcasting Ability</h3>
    <p>
      Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your paladin spells, since their power derives from the strength of your convictions. You use your
      Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC
      for a paladin spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Spell save DC =</strong> 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>
    <p><strong>Spell attack modifier =</strong> your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>

    <h3>Spellcasting Focus</h3>
    <p>You can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus for your paladin spells.</p>

    <h2 id="divine-smite">Divine Smite</h2>
    <p>
      Starting at 2nd level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one spell slot to deal radiant damage to the
      target, in addition to the weapon's damage. The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than
      1st, to a maximum of 5d8. The damage increases by 1d8 if the target is an undead or a fiend, to a maximum of 6d8.
    </p>

    <h2 id="divine-health">Divine Health</h2>
    <p>By 3rd level, the divine magic flowing through you makes you immune to disease.</p>

    <h2 id="sacred-oath">Sacred Oath</h2>
    <p>
      When you reach 3rd level, you swear the oath that binds you as a paladin forever. Up to this time you have been in a preparatory stage,
      committed to the path but not yet sworn to it. Choose <a href="#ancients">Ancients,</a> <a href="#conquest">Conquest</a>,
      <a href="#crown">Crown</a>, <a href="#devotion">Devotion</a>, <a href="#glory">Glory</a>, <a href="#redemption">Redemption</a>,
      <a href="#vengeance">Vengeance</a>, <a href="#watchers">Watchers</a>, or <a href="#oathbreaker">Oathbreaker</a>. Your choice grants you
      features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 15th, and 20th level. Those features include oath spells and the Channel Divinity feature.
    </p>

    <h3>Oath Spells</h3>
    <p>
      Each oath has a list of associated spells. You gain access to these spells at the levels specified in the oath description. Once you gain
      access to an oath spell, you always have it prepared. Oath spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.
    </p>
    <p>If you gain an oath spell that doesn't appear on the paladin spell list, the spell is nonetheless a paladin spell for you.</p>

    <h3>Channel Divinity</h3>
    <p>
      Your oath allows you to channel divine energy to fuel magical effects. Each Channel Divinity option provided by your oath explains how to
      use it.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which option to use. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your paladin spell save DC.
    </p>

    <h2>Ability Score Improvement</h2>
    <p>
      When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can
      increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.
    </p>

    <h2 id="extra-attack">Extra Attack</h2>
    <p>Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p>

    <h2 id="aura-of-protection">Aura of Protection</h2>
    <p>
      Starting at 6th level, whenever you or a friendly creature within 10 feet of you must make a saving throw, the creature gains a bonus to the
      saving throw equal to your Charisma modifier (with a minimum bonus of +1). You must be conscious to grant this bonus.
    </p>
    <p>At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.</p>

    <h2 id="aura-of-courage">Aura of Courage</h2>
    <p>Starting at 10th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you can't be frightened while you are conscious.</p>
    <p>At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.</p>

    <h2 id="improved-divine-smite">Improved Divine Smite</h2>
    <p>
      By 11th level, you are so suffused with righteous might that all your melee weapon strikes carry divine power with them. Whenever you hit a
      creature with a melee weapon, the creature takes an extra 1d8 radiant damage.
    </p>

    <h2 id="cleansing-touch">Cleansing Touch</h2>
    <p>Beginning at 14th level, you can use your action to end one spell on yourself or on one willing creature that you touch.</p>
    <p>
      You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain expended uses when you finish a
      long rest.
    </p>

    <h1>Sacred Oaths</h1>

    <h2 id="ancients">Oath of the Ancients</h2>
    <p>
      The Oath of the Ancients is as old as the race of elves and the rituals of the druids. Sometimes called fey knights, green knights, or horned
      knights, paladins who swear this oath cast their lot with the side of the light in the cosmic struggle against darkness because they love the
      beautiful and life-giving things of the world, not necessarily because they believe in principles of honor, courage, and justice. They adorn
      their armor and clothing with images of growing things-leaves, antlers, or flowers-to reflect their commitment to preserving life and light
      in the world.
    </p>

    <h3>Tenets of the Ancients</h3>
    <p>
      The tenets of the Oath of the Ancients have been preserved for uncounted centuries. This oath emphasizes the principles of good above any
      concerns of law or chaos. Its four central principles are simple.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Kindle the Light.</strong> Through your acts of mercy, kindness, and forgiveness, kindle the light of hope in the world, beating
      back despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Shelter the Light.</strong> Where there is good, beauty, love, and laughter in the world, stand against the wickedness that would
      swallow it. Where life flourishes, stand against the forces that would render it barren.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Preserve Your Own Light.</strong> Delight in song and laughter, in beauty and art. If you allow the light to die in your own
      heart, you can't preserve it in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Be the Light.</strong> Be a glorious beacon for all who live in despair. Let the light of your joy and courage shine forth in all
      your deeds.
    </p>

    <h3>Channel Divinity</h3>
    <p>When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Nature's Wrath.</strong> You can use your Channel Divinity to invoke primeval forces to ensnare a foe. As an action, you can
        cause spectral vines to spring up and reach for a creature within 10 feet of you that you can see. The creature must succeed on a
        Strength or Dexterity saving throw (its choice) or be restrained. While restrained by the vines, the creature repeats the saving throw at
        the end of each of its turns. On a success, it frees itself and the vines vanish.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Turn the Faithless.</strong> You can use your Channel Divinity to utter ancient words that are painful for fey and fiends to hear.
        As an action, you present your holy symbol, and each fey or fiend within 30 feet of you that can hear you must make a Wisdom saving throw.
        On a failed save, the creature is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet
      of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from
      moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.
    </p>
    <p>If the creature's true form is concealed by an illusion, shapeshifting, or other effect, that form is revealed while it is turned.</p>

    <h3>Aura of Warding</h3>
    <p>
      Beginning at 7th level, ancient magic lies so heavily upon you that it forms an eldritch ward. You and friendly creatures within 10 feet of
      you have resistance to damage from spells.
    </p>
    <p>At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.</p>

    <h3>Undying Sentinel</h3>
    <p>
      Starting at 15th level, when you are reduced to 0 hit points and are not killed outright, you can choose to drop to 1 hit point instead. Once
      you use this ability, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
    </p>
    <p>Additionally, you suffer none of the drawbacks of old age, and you can't be aged magically.</p>

    <h3>Elder Champion</h3>
    <p>
      At 20th level, you can assume the form of an ancient force of nature, taking on an appearance you choose. For example, your skin might turn
      green or take on a bark-like texture, your hair might become leafy or moss-like, or you might sprout antlers or a lion-like mane.
    </p>
    <p>Using your action, you undergo a transformation. For 1 minute, you gain the following benefits:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>At the start of each of your turns, you regain 10 hit points.</li>
      <li>Whenever you cast a paladin spell that has a casting time of 1 action, you can cast it using a bonus action instead.</li>
      <li>Enemy creatures within 10 feet of you have disadvantage on saving throws against your paladin spells and Channel Divinity options.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>

    <h2 id="conquest">Oath of Conquest</h2>
    <p>
      The Oath of Conquest calls to paladins who seek glory in battle and the subjugation of their enemies. It isn't enough for these paladins to
      establish order. They must crush the forces of chaos. Sometimes called knight tyrants or iron mongers, those who swear this oath gather into
      grim orders that serve gods or philosophies of war and well-ordered might.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of these paladins go so far as to consort with the powers of the Nine Hells, valuing the rule of law over the balm of mercy. The archdevil
      Bel, warlord of Avernus, counts many of these paladins—called hell knight—as his most ardent supporters. Hell knights cover their armor with
      trophies taken from fallen enemies, a grim warning to any who dare oppose them and the decrees of their lords. These knights are often most
      fiercely resisted by other paladins of this oath, who believe that the hell knights have wandered too far into darkness.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Tenets of Conquest</h3>
    <p>A paladin who takes this oath has the tenets of conquest seared on the upper arm.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Douse the Flame of Hope.</strong> It is not enough to merely defeat an enemy in battle. Your victory must be so overwhelming that your
      enemies' will to fight is shattered forever. A blade can end a life. Fear can end an empire.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Rule with an Iron Fist.</strong> Once you have conquered, tolerate no dissent. Your word is law. Those who obey it shall be favored.
      Those who defy it shall be punished as an example to all who might follow.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Strength Above All.</strong> You shall rule until a stronger one arises. Then you must grow mightier and meet the challenge, or fall to
      your own ruin.
    </p>

    <h3>Channel Divinity</h3>
    <p>When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Conquering Presence.</strong> You can use your Channel Divinity to exude a terrifying presence. As an action, you force each creature
        of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature becomes frightened of you
        for 1 minute. The frightened creature can repeat this saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Guided Strike.</strong> You can use your Channel Divinity to strike with supernatural accuracy. When you make an attack roll, you can
        use your Channel Divinity to gain a +10 bonus to the roll. You make this choice after you see the roll, but before the DM says whether the
        attack hits or misses.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Aura of Conquest</h3>
    <p>
      Starting at 7th level, you constantly emanate a menacing aura while you're not incapacitated. The aura extends 10 feet from you in every
      direction, but not through total cover.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a creature is frightened of you, its speed is reduced to 0 while in the aura, and that creature takes psychic damage equal to half your
      paladin level if it starts its turn there.
    </p>
    <p>At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.</p>

    <h3>Scornful Rebuke</h3>
    <p>
      Starting at 15th level, those who dare to strike you are psychically punished for their audacity. Whenever a creature hits you with an attack,
      that creature takes psychic damage equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1) if you're not incapacitated.
    </p>

    <h3>Invincible Conqueror</h3>
    <p>
      At 20th level, you gain the ability to harness extraordinary martial prowess. As an action, you can magically become an avatar of conquest, gaining
      the following benefits for 1 minute:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>You have resistance to all damage.</li>
      <li>When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can make one additional attack as part of that action.</li>
      <li>Your melee weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>

    <h2 id="crown">Oath of the Crown</h2>
    <p>
      The Oath of the Crown is sworn to the ideals of civilization, be it the spirit of a nation, fealty to a sovereign, or service to a deity of law and
      rulership. The paladins who swear this oath dedicate themselves to serving society and, in particular, the just laws that hold society together.
      These paladins are the watchful guardians on the walls, standing against the chaotic tides of barbarism that threaten to tear down all that civilization
      has built, and are commonly known as guardians, exemplars, or sentinels. Often, paladins who swear this oath are members of an order of knighthood in
      service to a nation or a sovereign, and undergo their oath as part of their admission to the order's ranks.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Tenets of the Crown</h3>
    <p>The tenets of the Oath of the Crown are often set by the sovereign to which their oath is sworn, but generally emphasize the following tenets.</p>
    <p><strong>Law.</strong> The law is paramount. It is the mortar that holds the stones of civilization together, and it must be respected.</p>
    <p><strong>Loyalty.</strong> Your word is your bond. Without loyalty, oaths and laws are meaningless.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Courage.</strong> You must be willing to do what needs to be done for the sake of order, even in the face of overwhelming odds. If you don't act,
      then who will?
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Responsibility.</strong> You must deal with the consequences of your actions, and you are responsible for fulfilling your duties and obligations.

    <h3>Channel Divinity</h3>
    <p>When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Champion Challenge.</strong> As a bonus action, you issue a challenge that compels other creatures to do battle with you. Each creature of your
        choice that you can see within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature can't willingly move more than 30 feet away
        from you. This effect ends on the creature if you are incapacitated or die or if the creature is more than 30 feet away from you.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Turn the Tide.</strong> As a bonus action, you can bolster injured creatures with your Channel Divinity. Each creature of your choice that can
        hear you within 30 feet of you regains hit points equal to 1d6 + your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1) if it has no more than half of its hit points.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Divine Allegiance</h3>
    <p>
      Starting at 7th level, when a creature within 5 feet of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to magically substitute your own health for that of the
      target creature, causing that creature not to take the damage. Instead, you take the damage. This damage to you can't be reduced or prevented in any way.
    </p>

    <h3>Unyielding Saint</h3>
    <p>Starting at 15th level, you have advantage on saving throws to avoid becoming paralyzed or stunned.</p>

    <h3>Exalted Champion</h3>
    <p>
      At 20th level, your presence on the field of battle is an inspiration to those dedicated to your cause. You can use your action to gain the following
      benefits for 1 hour:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons.</li>
      <li>Your allies have advantage on death saving throws while within 30 feet of you.</li>
      <li>You have advantage on Wisdom saving throws, as do your allies within 30 feet of you.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This effect ends early if you are incapacitated or die. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>

    <h2 id="crown">Oath of the Crown</h2>
    <p>
      The Oath of Devotion binds a paladin to the loftiest ideals of justice, virtue, and order. Sometimes called cavaliers, white knights, or holy warriors, these
      paladins meet the ideal of the knight in shining armor, acting with honor in pursuit of justice and the greater good. They hold themselves to the highest
      standards of conduct, and some, for better or worse, hold the rest of the world to the same standards. Many who swear this oath are devoted to gods of law and
      good and use their gods' tenets as the measure of their devotion. They hold angels—the perfect servants of good—as their ideals, and incorporate images of
      angelic wings into their helmets or coats of arms.
    </p>

    <h3>Tenets of Devotion</h3>
    <p>Though the exact words and strictures of the Oath of Devotion vary, paladins of this oath share these tenets.</p>
    <p><strong>Honesty.</strong> Don't lie or cheat. Let your word be your promise.</p>
    <p><strong>Courage.</strong> Never fear to act, though caution is wise.</p>
    <p><strong>Compassion.</strong> Aid others, protect the weak, and punish those who threaten them. Show mercy to your foes, but temper it with wisdom.</p>
    <p>
      <strong></strong> Treat others with fairness, and let your honorable deeds be an example to them. Do as much good as possible while causing the least amount
      of harm.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Duty.</strong> Be responsible for your actions and their consequences, protect those entrusted to your care, and obey those who have just authority
      over you.
    </p>

    <h3>Channel Divinity</h3>
    <p>When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Sacred Weapon.</strong> As an action, you can imbue one weapon that you are holding with positive energy, using your Channel Divinity. For 1 minute,
        you add your Charisma modifier to attack rolls made with that weapon (with a minimum bonus of +1). The weapon also emits bright light in a 20-foot radius
        and dim light 20 feet beyond that. If the weapon is not already magical, it becomes magical for the duration.
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          You can end this effect on your turn as part of any other action. If you are no longer holding or carrying this weapon, or if you fall unconscious, this
          effect ends.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Turn the Unholy.</strong> As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring fiends and undead, using your Channel Divinity. Each
        fiend or undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1
        minute or until it takes damage.
        <ul>
          <li>
            A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also
            can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move,
            the creature can use the Dodge action.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Aura of Devotion</h3>
