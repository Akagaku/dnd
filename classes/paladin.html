    <h1>Class Features</h1>
    <p>As a paladin, you gain the following class features.</p>

    <h3>Hit Points</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Hit Dice:</strong> 1d10 per paladin level<br>
      <strong>Hit Points at 1st Level:</strong> 10 + your Constitution modifier<br>
      <strong>Hit Points at Higher Levels:</strong> 1d10 (or 6) + your Constitution modifier<br>
    </p>
    <h3>Proficiencies</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Armor:</strong> All armor, shields<br>
      <strong>Weapons:</strong> Simple weapons, martial weapons<br>
      <strong>Tools:</strong> None<br>
      <strong>Saving Throws:</strong> Wisdom, Charisma<br>
      <strong>Skills:</strong> Choose two from Athletics, Insight, Intimidation, Medicine, Persuasion, and Religion
    </p>
    <h3>Equipment</h3>
    <p>You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>(a) a martial weapon and a shield or (b) two martial weapons</li>
      <li>(a) five javelins or (b) any simple melee weapon</li>
      <li>(a) a priest's pack or (b) an explorer's pack</li>
      <li>Chain mail and a holy symbol</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="divine-sense">Divine Sense</h2>
    <p>
      The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a noxious odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly music in your ears. As an
      action, you can open your awareness to detect such forces. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any celestial, fiend,
      or undead within 60 feet of you that is not behind total cover. You know the type (celestial, fiend, or undead) of any being whose presence
      you sense, but not its identity (the vampire Count Strahd von Zarovich, for instance). Within the same radius, you also detect the presence
      of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the Hallow spell.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier. When you finish a long rest, you regain all expended uses.
    </p>

    <h2 id="lay-on-hands">Lay on Hands</h2>
    <p>
      Your blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool of healing power that replenishes when you take a long rest. With that pool, you can
      restore a total number of hit points equal to your paladin level x 5.
    </p>
    <p>
      As an action, you can touch a creature and draw power from the pool to restore a number of hit points to that creature, up to the maximum
      amount remaining in your pool.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from your pool of healing to cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting
      it. You can cure multiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single use of Lay on Hands, expending hit points separately for
      each one.
    </p>
    <p>This feature has no effect on undead and constructs.</p>

    <h2 id="fighting-style">Fighting Style</h2>
    <p>
      You adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more
      than once, even if you later get to choose again.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Archery.</strong> You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Blind Fighting.</strong> You have blindsight with a range of 10 feet. Within that range, you can effectively see anything that
        isn't behind total cover, even if you're blinded or in darkness. Moreover, you can see an invisible creature within that range, unless the
        creature successfully hides from you.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Defense.</strong> While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Dueling.</strong> When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with
        that weapon.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Great Weapon Fighting.</strong> When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are
        wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the
        two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Interception.</strong> When a creature you can see hits a target, other than you, within 5 feet of you with an attack, you can use
        your reaction to reduce the damage the target takes by 1d10 + your proficiency bonus (to a minimum of 0 damage). You must be wielding a
        shield or a simple or martial weapon to use this reaction.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Protection.</strong> When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your
        reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Superior Technique.</strong> You learn one maneuver of your choice from among those available to the Battle Master archetype. If a
        maneuver you use requires your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver's effects, the saving throw DC equals 8 + your
        proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice).
        <ul>
          <li>
            You gain one superiority die, which is a d6 (this die is added to any superiority dice you have from another source). This die is used
            to fuel your maneuvers. A superiority die is expended when you use it. You regain your expended superiority dice when you finish a
            short or long rest.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Thrown Weapon Fighting.</strong> You can draw a weapon that has the thrown property as part of the attack you make with the weapon.
        <ul>
          <li>In addition, when you hit with a ranged attack using a thrown weapon, you gain a +2 bonus to the damage roll.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Two-Weapon Fighting.</strong> When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the
        second attack.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Unarmed Fighting.</strong> Your unarmed strikes can deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier on a hit. If you
        aren't wielding any weapons or a shield when you make the attack roll, the d6 becomes a d8.
        <ul>
          <li>At the start of each of your turns, you can deal 1d4 bludgeoning damage to one creature grappled by you.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="spellcasting">Spellcasting</h2>
    <p>By 2nd level, you have learned to draw on divine magic through meditation and prayer to cast spells as a cleric does.</p>

    <h3>Preparing and Casting Spells</h3>
    <p>
      The Paladin table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your paladin spells. To cast one of your paladin spells of 1st level or higher,
      you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      You prepare the list of paladin spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the paladin spell list. When you do so, choose a
      number of paladin spells equal to your Charisma modifier + half your paladin level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be
      of a level for which you have spell slots.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, if you are a 5th-level paladin, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Charisma of 14, your list of
      prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell Cure Wounds, you can
      cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of paladin spells requires time spent in
      prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.
    </p>

    <h3>Spellcasting Ability</h3>
    <p>
      Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your paladin spells, since their power derives from the strength of your convictions. You use your
      Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC
      for a paladin spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Spell save DC =</strong> 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>
    <p><strong>Spell attack modifier =</strong> your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>

    <h3>Spellcasting Focus</h3>
    <p>You can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus for your paladin spells.</p>

    <h2 id="divine-smite">Divine Smite</h2>
    <p>
      Starting at 2nd level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one spell slot to deal radiant damage to the
      target, in addition to the weapon's damage. The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than
      1st, to a maximum of 5d8. The damage increases by 1d8 if the target is an undead or a fiend, to a maximum of 6d8.
    </p>

    <h2 id="divine-health">Divine Health</h2>
    <p>By 3rd level, the divine magic flowing through you makes you immune to disease.</p>

    <h2 id="sacred-oath">Sacred Oath</h2>
    <p>
      When you reach 3rd level, you swear the oath that binds you as a paladin forever. Up to this time you have been in a preparatory stage,
      committed to the path but not yet sworn to it. Choose <a href="#ancients">Ancients,</a> <a href="#conquest">Conquest</a>,
      <a href="#crown">Crown</a>, <a href="#devotion">Devotion</a>, <a href="#glory">Glory</a>, <a href="#redemption">Redemption</a>,
      <a href="#vengeance">Vengeance</a>, <a href="#watchers">Watchers</a>, or <a href="#oathbreaker">Oathbreaker</a>. Your choice grants you
      features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 15th, and 20th level. Those features include oath spells and the Channel Divinity feature.
    </p>

    <h3>Oath Spells</h3>
    <p>
      Each oath has a list of associated spells. You gain access to these spells at the levels specified in the oath description. Once you gain
      access to an oath spell, you always have it prepared. Oath spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.
    </p>
    <p>If you gain an oath spell that doesn't appear on the paladin spell list, the spell is nonetheless a paladin spell for you.</p>

    <h3>Channel Divinity</h3>
    <p>
      Your oath allows you to channel divine energy to fuel magical effects. Each Channel Divinity option provided by your oath explains how to
      use it.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which option to use. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your paladin spell save DC.
    </p>

    <h2>Ability Score Improvement</h2>
    <p>
      When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can
      increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.
    </p>

    <h2 id="extra-attack">Extra Attack</h2>
    <p>Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p>

    <h2 id="aura-of-protection">Aura of Protection</h2>
    <p>
      Starting at 6th level, whenever you or a friendly creature within 10 feet of you must make a saving throw, the creature gains a bonus to the
      saving throw equal to your Charisma modifier (with a minimum bonus of +1). You must be conscious to grant this bonus.
    </p>
    <p>At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.</p>

    <h2 id="aura-of-courage">Aura of Courage</h2>
    <p>Starting at 10th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you can't be frightened while you are conscious.</p>
    <p>At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.</p>

    <h2 id="improved-divine-smite">Improved Divine Smite</h2>
    <p>
      By 11th level, you are so suffused with righteous might that all your melee weapon strikes carry divine power with them. Whenever you hit a
      creature with a melee weapon, the creature takes an extra 1d8 radiant damage.
    </p>

    <h2 id="cleansing-touch">Cleansing Touch</h2>
    <p>Beginning at 14th level, you can use your action to end one spell on yourself or on one willing creature that you touch.</p>
    <p>
      You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain expended uses when you finish a
      long rest.
