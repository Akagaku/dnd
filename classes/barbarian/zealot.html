    <h1>Barbarian: Path of the Zealot</h1>
    <p>
      Some deities inspire their followers to pitch themselves into a ferocious battle fury. These barbarians are zealotsâ€”warriors who channel
      their rage into powerful displays of divine power.
    </p>

    <h2>Divine Fury</h2>
    <p>
      Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you can channel divine fury into your weapon strikes. While you're raging, the first
      creature you hit on each of your turns with a weapon attack takes extra damage equal to 1d6 + half your Barbarian level. The extra damage is
      necrotic or radiant; you choose the type of damage when you gain this feature.
    </p>

    <h2>Warrior of the Gods</h2>
    <p>
      At 3rd level, your soul is marked for endless battle. If a spell, such as Raise Dead, has the sole effect of restoring you to life (but not
      undeath), the caster doesn't need material components to cast the spell on you.
    </p>

    <h2>Fanatical Focus</h2>
    <p>
      Starting at 6th level, the divine power that fuels your rage can protect you. If you fail a saving throw while raging, you can reroll it, and
      you must use the new roll. You can use this ability only once per rage.
    </p>

    <h2>Zealous Presence</h2>
    <p>
      At 10th level, you learn to channel divine power to inspire zealotry in others. As a bonus action, you unleash a battle cry infused with
      divine energy. Up to ten other creatures of your choice within 60 feet of you that can hear you gain advantage on attack rolls and saving
      throws until the start of your next turn.
    </p>
    <p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>

    <h2>Rage Beyond Death</h2>
    <p>Beginning at 14th level, the divine power that fuels your rage allows you to shrug off fatal blows.</p>
    <p>
      While you're raging, having 0 hit points doesn't knock you unconscious. You still must make death saving throws, and you suffer the normal
      effects of taking damage while at 0 hit points. However, if you would die due to failing death saving throws, you don't die until your rage
      ends, and you die then only if you still have 0 hit points.
