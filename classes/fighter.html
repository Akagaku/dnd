    </ul>

    <h2 id="fighting-style">Fighting Style</h2>
    <p>
      You adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more
      than once, even if you later get to choose again.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Archery.</strong> You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Blind Fighting.</strong> You have blindsight with a range of 10 feet. Within that range, you can effectively see anything that
        isn't behind total cover, even if you're blinded or in darkness. Moreover, you can see an invisible creature within that range, unless the
        creature successfully hides from you.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Defense.</strong> While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Dueling.</strong> When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with
        that weapon.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Great Weapon Fighting.</strong> When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are
        wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the
        two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Interception.</strong> When a creature you can see hits a target, other than you, within 5 feet of you with an attack, you can use
        your reaction to reduce the damage the target takes by 1d10 + your proficiency bonus (to a minimum of 0 damage). You must be wielding a
        shield or a simple or martial weapon to use this reaction.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Protection.</strong> When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your
        reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Superior Technique.</strong> You learn one maneuver of your choice from among those available to the Battle Master archetype. If a
        maneuver you use requires your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver's effects, the saving throw DC equals 8 + your
        proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice).
        <ul>
          <li>
            You gain one superiority die, which is a d6 (this die is added to any superiority dice you have from another source). This die is used
            to fuel your maneuvers. A superiority die is expended when you use it. You regain your expended superiority dice when you finish a
            short or long rest.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Thrown Weapon Fighting.</strong> You can draw a weapon that has the thrown property as part of the attack you make with the weapon.
        <ul>
          <li>In addition, when you hit with a ranged attack using a thrown weapon, you gain a +2 bonus to the damage roll.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Two-Weapon Fighting.</strong> When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the
        second attack.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Unarmed Fighting.</strong> Your unarmed strikes can deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier on a hit. If you
        aren't wielding any weapons or a shield when you make the attack roll, the d6 becomes a d8.
        <ul>
          <li>At the start of each of your turns, you can deal 1d4 bludgeoning damage to one creature grappled by you.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="second-wind">Second Wind</h2>
    <p>
      You have a limited well of stamina that you can draw on to protect yourself from harm. On your turn, you can use a bonus action to regain
      hit points equal to 1d10 + your fighter level.
    </p>
    <p>Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.</p>

    <h2 id="action-surge">Action Surge</h2>
    <p>Starting at 2nd level, you can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment. On your turn, you can take one additional action.</p>
    <p>
      Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again. Starting at 17th level, you can use it twice
      before a rest, but only once on the same turn.
    </p>

    <h2 id="martial-archetype">Martial Archetype</h2>
    <p>
      At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive to emulate in your combat styles and techniques. Choose
      <a href="#arcane-archer">Arcane Archer</a>, <a href="#banneret">Banneret</a>, <a href="#battle-master">Battle Master</a>,
      <a href="#cavalier">Cavalier</a>, <a href="#champion">Champion</a>, <a href="#echo-knight">Echo Knight</a>,
      <a href="#eldritch-knight">Eldritch Knight</a>, <a href="#psi-warrior">Psi Warrior</a>, <a href="#rune-knight">Rune Knight</a>,
      or <a href="#samurai">Samurai</a>. The archetype you choose grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th level.
    </p>

    <h2>Ability Score Improvement</h2>
    <p>
      When you reach 4th level, and again at 6th, 8th, 12th, 14th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2,
      or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.
    </p>

    <h2 id="extra-attack">Extra Attack</h2>
    <p>Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p>
    <p>The number of attacks increases to three when you reach 11th level in this class and to four when you reach 20th level in this class.</p>

    <h2 id="indomitable">Indomitable</h2>
    <p>
      Beginning at 9th level, you can reroll a saving throw that you fail. If you do so, you must use the new roll, and you can't use this feature
      again until you finish a long rest.
    </p>
    <p>You can use this feature twice between long rests starting at 13th level and three times between long rests starting at 17th level.</p>

    <h1>Martial Archetypes</h1>

    <h2 id="arcane-archer">Arcane Archer</h2>
    <p>
      This subclass has a bunch of lore flavor text that I had to delete because it makes elves look like magical, graceful warriors, but my elves
      are heartless, savage killers. It's not like it matters; you're not gonna choose this one. It's probably the most disappointing subclass in
      the game. "Arcane Archer" sounds so cool, and it was pretty interesting in older editions as a prestige class, but they just made it so
      boring in 5th edition for some reason.
    </p>

    <h3>Arcane Archer Lore</h3>
    <p>
      At 3rd level, you learn magical theory or some of the secrets of nature—typical for practitioners of of this elven martial tradition. You
      choose to gain proficiency in either the Arcana or the Nature skill, and you choose to learn either the Prestidigitation or Druidcraft
      cantrip.
    </p>

    <h3>Arcane Shot</h3>
    <p>
      At 3rd level, you learn to unleash special magical effects with some of your shots. When you gain this feature, you learn two Arcane Shot
      options of your choice (see "Arcane Shot Options" below).
    </p>
    <p>
      Once per turn when you fire an arrow from a shortbow or longbow as part of the Attack action, you can apply one of your Arcane Shot options
      to that arrow. You decide to use the option when the arrow hits, unless the option doesn't involve an attack roll. You have two uses of this
      ability, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a short or long rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      You gain an additional Arcane Shot option of your choice when you reach certain levels in this class: 7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th level. Each
      option also improves when you become an 18th-level fighter.
    </p>

    <h3>Magic Arrow</h3>
    <p>
      At 7th level, you gain the ability to infuse arrows with magic. Whenever you fire a nonmagical arrow from a shortbow or longbow, you can
      make it magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. The magic fades from the arrow
      immediately after it hits or misses its target.
    </p>

    <h3>Curving Shot</h3>
    <p>
      At 7th level, you learn how to direct an errant arrow toward a new target. When you make an attack roll with a magic arrow and miss, you can
      use a bonus action to reroll the attack roll against a different target within 60 feet of the original target.
    </p>

    <h3>Ever-Ready Shot</h3>
    <p>
      Starting at 15th level, your magical archery is available whenever battle starts. If you roll initiative and have no uses of Arcane Shot
      remaining, you regain one use of it.
    </p>

    <h3>Arcane Shot Options</h3>
    <p>
      The Arcane Shot feature lets you choose options for it at certain levels. The options are presented here in alphabetical order. They are all
      magical effects, and each one is associated with one of the schools of magic.
    </p>
    <p>If an option requires a saving throw, your Arcane Shot save DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Banishing Arrow.</strong> You use abjuration magic to try to temporarily banish your target to a harmless location in the Feywild.
      The creature hit by the arrow must also succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be banished. While banished in this way, its speed is 0, and
      it is incapacitated. At the end of its next turn, the target reappears in the space it vacated or in the nearest unoccupied space if that
      space is occupied.
    </p>
    <p>After you reach 18th level in this class, a target also takes 2d6 force damage when the arrow hits it.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Beguiling Arrow.</strong> Your enchantment magic causes this arrow to temporarily beguile its target. The creature hit by the arrow
      takes an extra 2d6 psychic damage, and choose one of your allies within 30 feet of the target. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving
      throw, or it is charmed by the chosen ally until the start of your next turn. This effect ends early if the chosen ally attacks the charmed
      target, deals damage to it, or forces it to make a saving throw.
    </p>
    <p>The psychic damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Bursting Arrow.</strong> You imbue your arrow with force energy drawn from the school of evocation. The arrow detonates after your
      attack. Immediately after the arrow hits the creature, the target and all other creatures within 10 feet of it take 2d6 force damage each.
    </p>
    <p>The force damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Enfeebling Arrow.</strong> You weave necromantic magic into your arrow. The creature hit by the arrow takes an extra 2d6 necrotic
      damage. The target must also succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or the damage dealt by its weapon attacks is halved until the start of
      your next turn.
    </p>
    <p>The necrotic damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Grasping Arrow.</strong> When this arrow strikes its target, conjuration magic creates grasping, poisonous brambles, which wrap
      around the target. The creature hit by the arrow takes an extra 2d6 poison damage, its speed is reduced by 10 feet, and it takes 2d6
      slashing damage the first time on each turn it moves 1 foot or more without teleporting. The target or any creature that can reach it can
      use its action to remove the brambles with a successful Strength (Athletics) check against your Arcane Shot save DC. Otherwise, the brambles
      last for 1 minute or until you use this option again.
    </p>
    <p>The poison damage and slashing damage both increase to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Piercing Arrow.</strong> You use transmutation magic to give your arrow an ethereal quality. When you use this option, you don't
      make an attack roll for the attack. Instead, the arrow fires forward in a line, which is 1 foot wide and 30 feet long, before disappearing.
      The arrow passes harmlessly through objects, ignoring cover. Each creature in that line must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed
      save, a creature takes damage as if it were hit by the arrow, plus an extra 1d6 piercing damage. On a successful save, a target takes half
      as much damage.
    </p>
    <p>The piercing damage increases to 2d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Seeking Arrow.</strong> Using divination magic, you grant your arrow the ability to seek out your target, allowing the arrow to
      curve and twist its path in search of its prey. When you use this option, you don't make an attack roll for the attack. Instead, choose one
      creature you have seen in the past minute. The arrow flies toward that creature, moving around corners if necessary and ignoring
      three-quarters cover and half cover. If the target is within the weapon's range and there is a path large enough for the arrow to travel to
      the target, the target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it takes damage as if it were hit by the arrow, plus an extra
      1d6 force damage, and you learn the target's current location. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage, and you don't
      learn its location.
    </p>
    <p>The force damage increases to 2d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Shadow Arrow.</strong> You weave illusion magic into your arrow, causing it to occlude your foe's vision with shadows. The creature
      hit by the arrow takes an extra 2d6 psychic damage, and it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be unable to see anything farther than 5
      feet away until the start of your next turn.
    </p>
    <p>The psychic damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.</p>

    <h2 id="battle-master">Battle Master</h2>
    <p>
      Those who emulate the archetypal Battle Master employ martial techniques passed down through generations. To a Battle Master, combat is an
      academic field, sometimes including subjects beyond battle such as weaponsmithing and calligraphy. Not every fighter absorbs the lessons of
      history, theory, and artistry that are reflected in the Battle Master archetype, but those who do are well-rounded fighters of great skill
      and knowledge.
    </p>

    <h3>Combat Superiority</h3>
    <p>When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn maneuvers that are fueled by special dice called superiority dice.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Maneuvers.</strong> You learn three maneuvers of your choice. Many maneuvers enhance an attack in some way. You can use only one
      maneuver per attack. You learn two additional maneuvers of your choice at 7th, 10th, and 15th level. Each time you learn new maneuvers, you
      can also replace one maneuver you know with a different one.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Superiority Dice.</strong> You have four superiority dice, which are d8s. A superiority die is expended when you use it. You regain
      all of your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest. You gain another superiority die at 7th level and one more at
      15th level.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Saving Throws.</strong> Some of your maneuvers require your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver's effects. The
      saving throw DC is calculated as follows:
    </p>
    <p><strong>Maneuver save DC =</strong> 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice)</p>

    <h3>Student of War</h3>
    <p>At 3rd level, you gain proficiency with one type of artisan's tools of your choice.</p>

    <h3>Know Your Enemy</h3>
    <p>
      Starting at 7th level, if you spend at least 1 minute observing or interacting with another creature outside combat, you can learn certain
      information about its capabilities compared to your own. The DM tells you if the creature is your equal, superior, or inferior in regard to
      two of the following characteristics of your choice:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Strength Score</li>
      <li>Dexterity Score</li>
      <li>Constitution Score</li>
      <li>Armor Class</li>
      <li>Current hit points</li>
      <li>Total class levels, if any</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Improved Combat Superiority</h3>
    <p>At 10th level, your superiority dice turn into d10s. At 18th level, they turn into d12s.</p>

    <h3>Relentless</h3>
    <p>Starting at 15th level, when you roll initiative and have no superiority dice remaining, you regain 1 superiority die.</p>

    <h2 id="cavalier">Cavalier</h2>
    <p>
      The archetypal cavalier excels at mounted combat. Usually born among the nobility and raised at court, a cavalier is equally at home leading
      a cavalry charge or exchanging repartee at a state dinner. Cavaliers also learn how to guard those in their charge from harm, often serving
      as the protectors of their superiors and of the weak. Compelled to right wrongs or earn prestige, many of these fighters leave their lives
      of comfort to embark on glorious adventure.
    </p>

    <h3>Bonus Proficiency</h3>
    <p>
      When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: Animal Handling, History,
      Insight, Performance, or Persuasion. Alternatively, you learn one language of your choice.
    </p>

    <h3>Born to Saddle</h3>
    <p>
      Starting at 3rd level, your mastery as a rider becomes apparent. You have advantage on saving throws made to avoid falling off your mount.
      If you fall off your mount and descend no more than 10 feet, you can land on your feet if you're not incapacitated.
    </p>
    <p>Finally, mounting or dismounting a creature costs you only 5 feet of movement, rather than half your speed.</p>

    <h3>Unwavering Mark</h3>
    <p>
      Starting at 3rd level, you can menace your foes, foiling their attacks and punishing them for harming others. When you hit a creature with a
      melee weapon attack, you can mark the creature until the end of your next turn. This effect ends early if you are incapacitated or you die,
      or if someone else marks the creature.
    </p>
    <p>While it is within 5 feet of you, a creature marked by you has disadvantage on any attack roll that doesn't target you.</p>
    <p>
      In addition, if a creature marked by you deals damage to anyone other than you, you can make a special melee weapon attack against the
      marked creature as a bonus action on your next turn. You have advantage on the attack roll, and if it hits, the attack's weapon deals extra
      damage to the target equal to half your fighter level.
    </p>
    <p>
      Regardless of the number of creatures you mark, you can make this special attack a number of times equal to your Strength modifier (a
      minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.
    </p>

    <h3>Warding Maneuver</h3>
    <p>
      At 7th level, you learn to fend off strikes directed at you, your mount, or other creatures nearby. If you or a creature you can see within
      5 feet of you is hit by an attack, you can roll 1d8 as a reaction if you're wielding a melee weapon or a shield. Roll the die, and add the
      number rolled to the target's AC against that attack. If the attack still hits, the target has resistance against the attack's damage.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (a minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses of it
      when you finish a long rest.
    </p>

    <h3>Hold the Line</h3>
    <p>
      At 10th level, you become a master of locking down your enemies. Creatures provoke an opportunity attack from you when they move 5 feet or
      more while within your reach, and if you hit a creature with an opportunity attack, the target's speed is reduced to 0 until the end of the
      current turn.
    </p>

    <h3>Ferocious Charger</h3>
    <p>
      Starting at 15th level, you can run down your foes, whether you're mounted or not. If you move at least 10 feet in a straight line right
      before attacking a creature and you hit it with the attack, that target must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency
      bonus + your Strength modifier) or be knocked prone. You can use this feature only once on each of your turns.
    </p>

    <h3>Vigilant Defender</h3>
    <p>
      Starting at 18th level, you respond to danger with extraordinary vigilance. In combat, you get a special reaction that you can take once on
      every creature's turn, except your turn. You can use this special reaction only to make an opportunity attack, and you can't use it on the
      same turn that you take your normal reaction.
    </p>

    <h2 id="champion">Champion</h2>
    <p>
      The archetypal Champion focuses on the development of raw physical power honed to deadly perfection. Those who model themselves on this
      archetype combine rigorous training with physical excellence to deal devastating blows.
    </p>

    <h3>Improved Critical</h3>
    <p>Beginning when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, your weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.</p>

    <h3>Remarkable Athlete</h3>
    <p>
      Starting at 7th level, you can add half your proficiency bonus (rounded up) to any Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution check you make that
      doesn't already use your proficiency bonus.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, when you make a running long jump, the distance you can cover increases by a number of feet equal to your Strength modifier.
    </p>

    <h3>Additional Fighting Style</h3>
    <p>At 10th level, you can choose a second option from the Fighting Style class feature.</p>

    <h3>Superior Critical</h3>
    <p>Starting at 15th level, your weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 18-20.</p>

    <h3>Survivor</h3>
    <p>
      At 18th level, you attain the pinnacle of resilience in battle. At the start of each of your turns, you regain hit points equal to 5 + your
      Constitution modifier if you have no more than half of your hit points left. You don't gain this benefit if you have 0 hit points.
    </p>

    <h2 id="echo-knight">Echo Knight</h2>
    <p>
      Mysterious and feared frontline warriors, Echo Knights have mastered the art of summoning the fading shades of unrealized timelines to aid
      them in battle. Surrounded by echoes of their own might, they charge into the fray as a cycling swarm of shadows and strikes.
    </p>

    <h3>Manifest Echo</h3>
    <p>
      At 3rd level, you can use a bonus action to magically manifest an echo of yourself in an unoccupied space you can see within 15 feet of you.
      This echo is a magical, translucent, gray image of you that lasts until it is destroyed, until you dismiss it as a bonus action, until you
      manifest another echo, or until you're incapacitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your echo has AC 14 + your proficiency bonus, 1 hit point, and immunity to all conditions. If it has to make a saving throw, it uses your
      saving throw bonus for the roll. It is the same size as you, and it occupies its space. On your turn, you can mentally command the echo to
      move up to 30 feet in any direction (no action required). If your echo is ever more than 30 feet from you at the end of your turn, it is
      destroyed.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        As a bonus action, you can teleport, magically swapping places with your echo at a cost of 15 feet of your movement, regardless of the
        distance between the two of you.
      </li>
      <li>
        When you take the Attack action on your turn, any attack you make with that action can originate from your space or the echo's space. You
        make this choice for each attack.
      </li>
      <li>
        When a creature that you can see within 5 feet of your echo moves at least 5 feet away from it, you can use your reaction to make an
        opportunity attack against that creature as if you were in the echo's space.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Unleash Incarnation</h3>
    <p>
      At 3rd level, you can heighten your echo's fury. Whenever you take the Attack action, you can make one additional melee attack from the
      echo's position.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you
      finish a long rest.
    </p>

    <h3>Echo Avatar</h3>
    <p>
      Starting at 7th level, you can temporarily transfer your consciousness to your echo. As an action, you can see through your echo's eyes and
      hear through its ears. During this time, you are deafened and blinded. You can sustain this effect for up to 10 minutes, and you can end it
      at any time (requires no action). While your echo is being used in this way, it can be up to 1,000 feet away from you without being
      destroyed.
    </p>

    <h3>Shadow Martyr</h3>
    <p>
      Starting at 10th level, you can make your echo throw itself in front of an attack directed at another creature that you can see. Before the
      attack roll is made, you can use your reaction to teleport the echo to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the targeted creature. The
      attack roll that triggered the reaction is instead made against your echo.
    </p>
    <p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>

    <h3>Reclaim Potential</h3>
    <p>
      By 15th level, you've learned to absorb the fleeting magic of your echo. When an echo of yours is destroyed by taking damage, you can gain a
      number of temporary hit points equal to 2d6 + your Constitution modifier, provided you don't already have temporary hit points.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you
      finish a long rest.
    </p>

    <h3>Legion of One</h3>
    <p>
      At 18th level, you can use a bonus action to create two echos with your Manifest Echo feature, and these echoes can co-exist. If you try to
      create a third echo, the previous two echoes are destroyed. Anything you can do from one echo's position can be done from the other's
      instead.
    </p>
    <p>In addition, when you roll initiative and have no uses of your Unleash Incarnation feature left, you regain one use of that feature.</p>

    <h2 id="eldritch-knight">Eldritch Knight</h2>

    <h2 id="psi-warrior">Psi Warrior</h2>
    <p>
      Awake to the psionic power within, a Psi Warrior is a fighter who augments their physical might with psi-infused weapon strikes, telekinetic
      lashes, and barriers of mental force. As a Psi Warrior, you might have honed your psionic abilities through solo discipline, unlocked it
      under the tutelage of a master, or refined it at an academy dedicated to wielding the mind's power as both weapon and shield.
    </p>

    <h3>Psionic Power</h3>
    <p>
      At 3rd level, you harbor a wellspring of psionic energy within yourself. This energy is represented by your Psionic Energy dice, which are
      each a d6. You have a number of these dice equal to twice your proficiency bonus, and they fuel various psionic powers you have, which are
      detailed below.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of your powers expend the Psionic Energy die they use, as specified in a power's description, and you can't use a power if it requires
      you to use a die when your dice are all expended. You regain all your expended Psionic Energy dice when you finish a long rest. In addition,
      as a bonus action, you can regain one expended Psionic Energy die, but you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you reach certain levels in this class, the size of your Psionic Energy dice increases: at 5th level (d8), 11th level (d10), and 17th
      level (d12).
    </p>
    <p>The powers below use your Psionic Energy dice.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Protective Field.</strong> When you or another creature you can see within 30 feet of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to
      expend one Psionic Energy die, roll the die, and reduce the damage taken by the number rolled plus your Intelligence modifier (minimum
      reduction of 1), as you create a momentary shield of telekinetic force.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Psionic Strike.</strong> You can propel your weapons with psionic force. Once on each of your turns, immediately after you hit a
      target within 30 feet of you with an attack and deal damage to it with a weapon, you can expend one Psionic Energy die, rolling it and
      dealing force damage to the target equal to the number rolled plus your Intelligence modifier.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Telekinetic Movement.</strong> You can move an object or a creature with your mind. As an action, you target one loose object that
      is Large or smaller or one willing creature, other than yourself. If you can see the target and it is within 30 feet of you, you can move it
      up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. Alternatively, if it is a Tiny object, you can move it to or from your hand. Either way,
      you can move the target horizontally, vertically, or both. Once you take this action, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long
      rest, unless you expend a Psionic Energy die to take it again.
    </p>

    <h3>Telekinetic Adept</h3>
    <p>By the 7th level, You have mastered new ways to use your telekinetic abilities, detailed below.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Psi-Powered Leap.</strong> As a bonus action, you can propel your body with your mind. You gain a flying speed equal to twice your
      walking speed until the end of the current turn. Once you take this bonus action, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long
      rest, unless you expend a Psionic Energy die to take it again.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Telekinetic Thrust.</strong> When you deal damage to a target with your Psionic Strike, you can force the target to make a Strength
      saving throw against a DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier. If the save fails, you can knock the target
      prone or move it up to 10 feet in any direction horizontally.
    </p>

    <h3>Guarded Mind</h3>
    <p>
      Starting at 10th level, the psionic energy flowing through you has bolstered your mind. You have resistance to psychic damage. Moreover, if
      you start your turn charmed or frightened, you can expend a Psionic Energy die and end every effect on yourself subjecting you to those
      conditions.
    </p>

    <h3>Bulwark of Force</h3>
    <p>
      At 15th level, you can shield yourself and others with telekinetic force. As a bonus action, you can choose creatures, which can include
      you, that you can see within 30 feet of you, up to a number of creatures equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one creature). Each
      of the chosen creatures is protected by half cover for 1 minute or until you're incapacitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you take this bonus action, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a Psionic Energy die to take it again.
    </p>

    <h3>Telekinetic Master</h3>
    <p>
      By 18th level, your ability to move creatures and objects with your mind is matched by few. You can cast the Telekinesis spell, requiring no
      components, and your spellcasting ability for the spell is Intelligence. On each of your turns while you concentrate on the spell, including
      the turn when you cast it, you can make one attack with a weapon as a bonus action.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you cast the spell with this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a Psionic Energy die to
      cast it again.
    </p>

    <h2 id="rune-knight">Rune Knight</h2>
    <p>
      Rune Knights enhance their martial prowess using the supernatural power of runes, an ancient practice that originated with giants. Rune
      cutters can be found among any family of giants, and you likely learned your methods first or second hand from such a mystical artisan.
      Whether you found the giant's work carved into a hill or cave, learned of the runes from a sage, or met the giant in person, you studied the
      giant's craft and learned how to apply magic runes to empower your equipment.
    </p>

    <h3>Bonus Proficiencies</h3>
    <p>When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with smith's tools, and you learn to speak, read, and write Giant.</p>

    <h3>Rune Carver</h3>
    <p>
      Starting at 3rd level, you can use magic runes to enhance your gear. You learn two runes of your choice, from among the runes described
      below, and each time you gain a level in this class, you can replace one rune you know with a different one from this feature. When you
      reach certain levels in this class, you learn additional runes, as shown in the Runes Known table.

    <p>
      Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch a number of objects equal to the number of runes you know, and you inscribe a different rune
      onto each of the objects. To be eligible, an object must be a weapon, a suit of armor, a shield, a piece of jewelry, or something else you
      can wear or hold in a hand. Your rune remains on an object until you finish a long rest, and an object can bear only one of your runes at a
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following runes are available to you when you learn a rune. If a rune has a level requirement, you must be at least that level in this
      class to learn the rune. If a rune requires a saving throw, your Rune Magic save DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution
      modifier.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Cloud Rune.</strong> This rune emulates the deceptive magic used by some cloud giants. While wearing or carrying an object
        inscribed with this rune, you have advantage on Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks and Charisma (Deception) checks.
        <ul>
          <li>
            In addition, when you or a creature you can see within 30 feet of you is hit by an attack roll, you can use your reaction to invoke
            the rune and choose a different creature within 30 feet of you, other than the attacker. The chosen creature becomes the target of the
            attack, using the same roll. This magic can transfer the attack's effects regardless of the attack's range. Once you invoke this rune,
            you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Fire Rune.</strong> This rune's magic channels the masterful craftsmanship of great smiths. While wearing or carrying an object
        inscribed with this rune, your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses your proficiency with a tool.
        <ul>
          <li>
            In addition, when you hit a creature with an attack using a weapon, you can invoke the rune to summon fiery shackles: the target takes
            an extra 2d6 fire damage, and it must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be restrained for 1 minute. While restrained by the
            shackles, the target takes 2d6 fire damage at the start of each of its turns. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of
            each of its turns, banishing the shackles on a success. Once you invoke this rune, you can't do so again until you finish a short or
            long rest.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Frost Rune.</strong> This rune's magic evokes the might of those who survive in the wintry wilderness, such as frost giants. While
        wearing or carrying an object inscribed with this rune, you have advantage on Wisdom (Animal Handling) checks and Charisma (Intimidation)
        checks.
        <ul>
          <li>
            In addition, you can invoke the rune as a bonus action to increase your sturdiness. For 10 minutes, you gain a +2 bonus to all ability
            checks and saving throws that use Strength or Constitution. Once you invoke this rune, you can't do so again until you finish a short
            or long rest.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Stone Rune.</strong> This rune's magic channels the judiciousness associated with stone giants. While wearing or carrying an
        object inscribed with this rune, you have advantage on Wisdom (Insight) checks, and you have darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.
        <ul>
          <li>
            In addition, when a creature you can see ends its turn within 30 feet of you, you can use your reaction to invoke the rune and force
            the creature to make a Wisdom saving throw. Unless the save succeeds, the creature is charmed by you for 1 minute. While charmed in
            this way, the creature has a speed of 0 and is incapacitated, descending into a dreamy stupor. The creature repeats the saving throw
            at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. Once you invoke this rune, you can't do so again until you finish a
            short or long rest.

      <li>
        <strong>Hill Rune (7th Level or Higher).</strong> This rune's magic bestows a resilience reminiscent of a hill giant. While wearing or
        carrying an object that bears this rune, you have advantage on saving throws against being poisoned, and you have resistance against
        poison damage.
        <ul>
          <li>
            In addition, you can invoke the rune as a bonus action, gaining resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage for 1 minute.
            Once you invoke this rune, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Storm Rune (7th Level or Higher).</strong> Using this rune, you can glimpse the future like a storm giant seer. While wearing or
        carrying an object inscribed with this rune, you have advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks, and you can't be surprised as long as you
        aren't incapacitated.
        <ul>
          <li>
            In addition, you can invoke the rune as a bonus action to enter a prophetic state for 1 minute or until you're incapacitated. Until the
            state ends, when you or another creature you can see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, a saving throw, or an ability check,
            you can use your reaction to cause the roll to have advantage or disadvantage. Once you invoke this rune, you can't do so again until
            you finish a short or long rest.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Giant Might</h3>
    <p>
      At 3rd level, you have learned how to imbue yourself with the might of giants. As a bonus action, you magically gain the following benefits,
      which last for 1 minute:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        If you are smaller than Large, you become Large, along with anything you are wearing. If you lack the room to become Large, your size
        doesn't change.
      </li>
      <li>You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.</li>
      <li>

      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Runic Shield</h3>
    <p>
      At 7th level, you learn to invoke your rune magic to protect your allies. When another creature you can see within 60 feet of you is hit by
      an attack roll, you can use your reaction to force the attacker to reroll the d20 and use the new roll.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
    </p>

    <h3>Great Stature</h3>

      By 10th level, the magic of your runes permanently alters you. When you gain this feature, roll 3d4. You grow a number of inches in height
      equal to the roll.
    </p>
    <p>Moreover, the extra damage you deal with your Giant's Might feature increases to 1d8.</p>

    <h3>Master of Runes</h3>
    <p>
      At 15th level, you can invoke each rune you know from your Rune Carver feature twice, rather than once, and you regain all expended uses
      when you finish a short or long rest.
    </p>

    <h3>Runic Juggernaut</h3>
    <p>
      At 18th level, you learn how to amplify your rune-powered transformation. As a result, the extra damage you deal with the Giant's Might
      feature increases to 1d10. Moreover, when you use that feature, your size can increase to Huge, and while you are that size, your reach
      increases by 5 feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long
      rest.
    </p>

    <h2 id="samurai">Samurai</h2>
    <p>
      The Samurai is a fighter who draws on an implacable fighting spirit to overcome enemies. A samurai's resolve is nearly unbreakable, and the
      enemies in a samurai's path have two choices: yield or die fighting.
    </p>

    <h3>Bonus Proficiency</h3>
    <p>
      When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: History, Insight,
      Performance, or Persuasion. Alternatively, you learn one language of your choice.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Fighting Spirit</h3>
    <p>
      Starting at 3rd level, your intensity in battle can shield you and help you strike true. As a bonus action on your turn, you can give
      yourself advantage on all weapon attack rolls until the end of the current turn. When you do so, you also gain 5 temporary hit points. The
      number of hit points increases when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to 10 at 10th level and 15 at 15th level.
    </p>
    <p>You can use this feature three times. You regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.</p>

    <h3>Elegant Courtier</h3>
    <p>
      Starting at 7th level, your discipline and attention to detail allow you to excel in social situations. Whenever you make a Charisma
      (Persuasion) check, you gain a bonus to the check equal to your Wisdom modifier.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your self-control also causes you to gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws. If you already have this proficiency, you instead gain
      proficiency in Intelligence or Charisma saving throws (your choice).
    </p>

    <h3>Tireless Spirit</h3>
    <p>Starting at 10th level, when you roll initiative and have no uses of Fighting Spirit remaining, you regain one use.</p>

    <h3>Rapid Strike</h3>
    <p>
      Starting at 15th level, you learn to trade accuracy for swift strikes. If you take the Attack action on your turn and have advantage on an
      attack roll against against one of the targets, you can forgo the advantage for that roll to make an additional weapon attack against that
      target, as part of the same action. You can do so no more than once per turn.
    </p>

    <h3>Strength Before Death</h3>
    <p>
      Starting at 18th level, your fighting spirit can delay the grasp of death. If you take damage that reduces you to 0 hit points, you can use
      your reaction to delay falling unconscious, and you can immediately take an extra turn. While you have 0 hit points during that extra turn,
      taking damage causes death saving throw failures as normal, and three death saving throw failures can still kill you. When the extra turn
      ends, you fall unconscious if you still have 0 hit points.
    </p>
    <p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>
