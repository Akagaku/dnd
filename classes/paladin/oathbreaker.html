    <h1>Paladin: Oathbreaker</h1>
    <p>
      An oathbreaker is a paladin who breaks their sacred oaths to pursue some dark ambition or serve an evil power. Whatever light burned in the
      paladin's heart been extinguished. Only darkness remains.
    </p>
    <div class="alert">
      <p>
        If you want to play as a paladin who's betrayed their oath, this subclass may not actually be for you. Contrary to its name, the
        mechanics of this "oath" are less representative of a fallen paladin, and more in line with an Evil paladin. All was well and good in
        older editions when all paladins had to be Lawful Good, but the Oathbreaker may not be the best thematic match for former paladins of
        less ethically-concerned oaths, such as Conquest, Crown, Glory, or Vengeance.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Oath Spells</h2>

    <h2>Channel Divinity</h2>
    <p>When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Control Undead.</strong> As an action, you target one undead creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The target must make a
        Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target must obey your commands for the next 24 hours, or until you use this Channel Divinity
        option again. An undead whose challenge rating is equal to or greater than your paladin level is immune to this effect.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Dreadful Aspect.</strong> As an action, you channel the darkest emotions and focus them into a burst of magical menace. Each
        creature of your choice within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw if it can see you. On a failed save, the target is
        frightened of you for 1 minute. If a creature frightened by this effect ends its turn more than 30 feet away from you, it can attempt
        another Wisdom saving throw to end the effect on it.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Aura of Hate</h2>
    <p>
      Starting at 7th level you, as well any fiends and undead within 10 feet of you, gain a bonus to melee weapon damage rolls equal to your
      Charisma modifier (minimum of +1). A creature can benefit from this feature from only one paladin at a time.
    </p>
    <p>At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.</p>

    <h2>Supernatural Resistance</h2>
    <p>At 15th level, you gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons.</p>

    <h2>Dread Lord</h2>
    <p>
      At 20th level, you can, as an action, surround yourself with an aura of gloom that lasts for 1 minute. The aura reduces any bright light in
      a 30-foot radius around you to dim light. Whenever an enemy that is frightened by you starts its turn in the aura, it takes 4d10 psychic
      damage. Additionally, you and any creatures of your choosing in the aura are draped in deeper shadow. Creatures that rely on sight have
      disadvantage on attack rolls against creatures draped in this shadow.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the aura lasts, you can use a bonus action on your turn to cause the shadows in the aura to attack one creature. Make a melee spell
      attack against the target. If the attack hits, the target takes necrotic damage equal to 3d10 + your Charisma modifier.
    </p>
    <p>After activating the aura, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.</p>
