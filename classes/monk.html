    <h1>Monk</h1>
    <p>
      Monks are united in their ability to magically harness the energy that flows in their bodies. Whether channeled as a striking display of
      combat prowess or a subtler focus of defensive ability and speed, this energy infuses all that a monk does.
    </p>
    <p><em>You must have a Dexterity score and a Wisdom score of 13 or higher in order to multiclass in or out of this class.</em></p>

    <h1>Class Features</h1>
    <p>As a monk, you gain the following class features.</p>

    <h3>Hit Points</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Hit Dice:</strong> 1d8 per monk level<br>
      <strong>Hit Points at 1st Level:</strong> 8 + your Constitution modifier<br>
      <strong>Hit Points at Higher Levels:</strong> 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier<br>
    </p>
    <h3>Proficiencies</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Armor:</strong> None<br>
      <strong>Weapons:</strong> Simple weapons, shortswords<br>
      <strong>Tools:</strong> Choose one type of artisan's tools or one musical instrument<br>
      <strong>Saving Throws:</strong> Strength, Dexterity<br>
      <strong>Skills:</strong> Choose two from Acrobatics, Athletics, History, Insight, Religion, and Stealth
    </p>
    <h3>Equipment</h3>
    <p>You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>(a) a shortsword or (b) any simple weapon</li>
      <li>(a) a dungeoneer's pack or (b) an explorer's pack</li>
      <li>10 darts</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="unarmored-defense">Unarmored Defense</h2>
    <p>
      Beginning at 1st level, while you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Wisdom
      modifier.
    </p>

    <h2 id="martial-arts">Martial Arts</h2>
    <p>
      At 1st level, your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of combat styles that use unarmed strikes and monk weapons, which are
      shortswords and any simple melee weapons that don't have the two-handed or heavy property.
    </p>
    <p>You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only monk weapons and you aren't wearing armor or wielding a shield:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes and monk weapons.</li>
      <li>
        You can roll a d4 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike or monk weapon. This die changes as you gain monk levels, as shown
        in the Martial Arts column of the Monk table.
      </li>
      <li>
        When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action.
        For example, if you take the Attack action and attack with a quarterstaff, you can also make an unarmed strike as a bonus action, assuming
        you haven't already taken a bonus action this turn.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Certain monasteries use specialized forms of the monk weapons. For example, you might use a club that is two lengths of wood connected by a
      short chain (called a nunchaku) or a sickle with a shorter, straighter blade (called a kama). Whatever name you use for a monk weapon, you
      can use the game statistics provided for the weapon on the Weapons page.
    </p>

    <h2 id="ki">Ki</h2>
    <p>
      Starting at 2nd level, your training allows you to harness the mystic energy of ki. Your access to this energy is represented by a number of
      ki points. Your monk level determines the number of points you have, as shown in the Ki Points column of the Monk table.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can spend these points to fuel various ki features. You start knowing three such features: Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and Step of
      the Wind. You learn more ki features as you gain levels in this class.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you spend a ki point, it is unavailable until you finish a short or long rest, at the end of which you draw all of your expended ki
      back into yourself. You must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest meditating to regain your ki points.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of your ki features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as
      follows:
    </p>
    <p><strong>Ki save DC =</strong> 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Flurry of Blows. Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 1 ki point to make two unarmed strikes as a
        bonus action.
      </li>
      <li>Patient Defense. You can spend 1 ki point to take the Dodge action as a bonus action on your turn.</li>
      <li>
        Step of the Wind. You can spend 1 ki point to take the Disengage or Dash action as a bonus action on your turn, and your jump distance is
        doubled for the turn.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="unarmored-movement">Unarmored Movement</h2>
    <p>
      Starting at 2nd level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you are not wearing armor or wielding a shield. This bonus increases when you
      reach certain monk levels, as shown in the Monk table.
    </p>
    <p>At 9th level, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and across liquids on your turn without falling during the move.</p>
  
    <h2 id="monastic-tradition">Monastic Tradition</h2>
    <p>
      When you reach 3rd level, you commit yourself to a monastic tradition. Choose <a href="#astral-self">Astral Self</a>,
      <a href="#ascendant-dragon">Ascendant Dragon</a>, <a href="#drunken-master">Drunken Master</a>, <a href="#four-elements">Four Elements</a>,
      <a href="#kensei">Kensei</a>, <a href="#long-death">Long Death</a>, <a href="#mercy">Mercy</a>, <a href="#open-hand">Open Hand</a>,
      <a href="#shadow">Shadow</a>, or <a href="#sun-soul">Sun Soul</a>. Your tradition grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 11th,
      and 17th level.
    </p>

    <h2 id="deflect-missiles">Deflect Missiles</h2>
    <p>
      Starting at 3rd level, you can use your reaction to deflect or catch the missile when you are hit by a ranged weapon attack. When you do so,
      the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your monk level.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile if it is small enough for you to hold in one hand and you have at least one hand
      free. If you catch a missile in this way, you can spend 1 ki point to make a ranged attack with a range of 20/60 using the weapon or piece of
      ammunition you just caught, as part of the same reaction. You make this attack with proficiency, regardless of your weapon proficiencies, and
      the missile counts as a monk weapon for the attack.
    </p>

    <h2>Ability Score Increase</h2>
    <p>
      When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can
      increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.
    </p>

    <h2 id="slow-fall">Slow Fall</h2>
    <p>
      Beginning at 4th level, you can use your reaction when you fall to reduce any falling damage you take by an amount equal to five times your
      monk level.
    </p>

    <h2 id="extra-attack">Extra Attack</h2>
    <p>Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p>

    <h2 id="stunning-strike">Stunning Strike</h2>
    <p>
      Starting at 5th level, you can interfere with the flow of ki in an opponent's body. When you hit another creature with a melee weapon
      attack, you can spend 1 ki point to attempt a stunning strike. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be stunned until
      the end of your next turn.
    </p>

    <h2 id="ki-empowered-strikes">Ki-Empowered Strikes</h2>
    <p>
      Starting at 6th level, your unarmed strikes count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and
      damage.
    </p>

    <h2 id="evasion">Evasion</h2>
    <p>
      At 7th level, your instinctive agility lets you dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a blue dragon's lightning breath or a
      fireball spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead
      take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.
    </p>

    <h2 id="stillness-of-mind">Stillness of Mind</h2>
    <p>Starting at 7th level, you can use your action to end one effect on yourself that is causing you to be charmed or frightened.</p>
  
    <h2 id="purity-of-body">Purity of Body</h2>
    <p>At 10th level, your mastery of the ki flowing through you makes you immune to disease and poison.</p>

    <h2 id="tongue-of-sun-and-moon">Tongue of Sun and Moon</h2>
    <p>
      Starting at 13th level, you learn to touch the ki of other minds so that you understand all spoken languages. Moreover, any creature that
      can understand a language can understand what you say.
    </p>

    <h2 id="diamond-soul">Diamond Soul</h2>
    <p>Beginning at 14th level, your mastery of ki grants you proficiency in all saving throws.</p>
    <p>Additionally, whenever you make a saving throw and fail, you can spend 1 ki point to reroll it and take the second result.</p>

    <h2 id="timeless-body">Timeless Body</h2>
    <p>
      At 15th level, your ki sustains you so that you suffer none of the frailty of old age, and you can't be aged magically. You can still die of
      old age, however. In addition, you no longer need food or water.
    </p>

    <h2 id="empty-body">Empty Body</h2>
    <p>
      Beginning at 18th level, you can use your action to spend 4 ki points to become invisible for 1 minute. During that time, you also have
      resistance to all damage but force damage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, you can spend 8 ki points to cast the astral projection spell, without needing material components. When you do so, you can't
      take any other creatures with you.
    </p>

    <h2 id="perfect-self">Perfect Self</h2>
    <p>At 20th level, when you roll for initiative and have no ki points remaining, you regain 4 ki points.</p>

    <h1>Monastic Traditions</h1>

    <h2 id="astral-self">Way of the Astral Self</h2>
    <p>
      A monk who follows the Way of the Astral Self believes their body is an illusion. They see their ki as a representation of their true form,
      an astral self. This astral self has the capacity to be a force of order or disorder, with some monasteries training students to use their
      power to protect the weak and other instructing aspirants in how to manifest their true selves in service to the mighty.
    </p>
    <h3>Arms of the Astral Self</h3>
    <p>
      At 3rd level, your mastery of your ki allows you to summon a portion of your astral self. As a bonus action, you can spend 1 ki point to
      summon the arms of your astral self. When you do so, each creature of your choice that you can see within 10 feet of you must succeed on a
      Dexterity saving throw or take force damage equal to two rolls of your Martial Arts die.
    </p>
    <p>
      For 10 minutes, these spectral arms hover near your shoulders or surround your arms (your choice). You determine the arms' appearance, and
      they vanish early if you are incapacitated or die.
    </p>
    <p>While the spectral arms are present, you gain the following benefits:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You can use your Wisdom modifier in place of your Strength modifier when making Strength checks and Strength saving throws.</li>
      <li>You can use the spectral arms to make unarmed strikes.</li>
      <li>When you make an unarmed strike with the arms on your turn, your reach for it is 5 feet greater than normal.</li>
      <li>
        The unarmed strikes you make with the arms can use your Wisdom modifier in place of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and
        damage rolls, and their damage type is force.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Visage of the Astral Self</h3>
    <p>
      When you reach 6th level, you can summon the visage of your astral self. As a bonus action, or as part of the bonus action you take to
      activate Arms of the Astral Self, you can spend 1 ki point to summon this visage for 10 minutes. It vanishes early if you are incapacitated
      or die.
    </p>
    <p>The spectral visage covers your face like a helmet or mask. You determine its appearance.</p>
    <p>While the spectral visage is present, you gain the following benefits.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Astral Sight.</strong> You can see normally in darkness, both magical and nonmagical, to a distance of 120 feet.</li>
      <li><strong>Wisdom of the Spirit.</strong> You have advantage on Wisdom (Insight) and Charisma (Intimidation) checks.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Word of the Spirit.</strong> When you speak, you can direct your words to a creature of your choice that you can see within 60 feet
        of you, making it so only that creature can hear you. Alternatively, you can amplify your voice so that all creatures within 600 feet can
        hear you.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Body of the Astral Self</h3>
    <p>
      Starting at 11th level, when you have both your astral arms and visage summoned, you can cause the body of your astral self to appear (no
      action required). This spectral body covers your physical form like a suit of armor, connecting with the arms and visage. You determine its
      appearance.
    </p>
    <p>While the spectral body is present, you gain the following benefits.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Deflect Energy.</strong> When you take acid, cold, fire, force, lightning, or thunder damage, you can use your reaction to deflect
        it. When you do so, the damage you take is reduced by 1d10 + your Wisdom modifier (minimum reduction of 1).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Empowered Arms.</strong> Once on each of your turns when you hit a target with the Arms of the Astral Self, you can deal extra
        damage to the target equal to your Martial Arts die.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Awakened Astral Self</h3>
    <p>
      Starting at 17th level, your connection to your astral self is complete, allowing you to unleash its full potential. As a bonus action, you
      can spend 5 ki points to summon the arms, visage, and body of your astral self and awaken it for 10 minutes. This awakening ends early if
      you are incapacitated or die.
    </p>
    <p>While your astral self is awakened, you gain the following benefits.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Armor of the Spirit.</strong> You gain a +2 bonus to Armor Class.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Astral Barrage.</strong> Whenever you use the Extra Attack feature to attack twice, you can instead attack three times if all the
        attacks are made with your astral arms.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="ascendant-dragon">Way of the Ascendant Dragon</h2>

    <h2 id="drunken-master">Way of the Drunken Master</h2>
    <p>
      The Way of the Drunken Master teaches its students to move with the jerky, unpredictable movements of a drunkard. A drunken master sways,
      tottering on unsteady feet, to present what seems like an incompetent combatant who proves frustrating to engage. The drunken master's
      erratic stumbles conceal a carefully executed dance of blocks, parries, advances, attacks, and retreats.
    </p>
    <p>
      A drunken master often enjoys playing the fool to bring gladness to the despondent or to demonstrate humility to the arrogant, but when
      battle is joined, the drunken master can be a maddening, masterful foe.
    </p>

    <h3>Bonus Proficiencies</h3>
    <p>
      When you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in the Performance skill if you don't already have it. Your martial arts
      technique mixes combat training with the precision of a dancer and the antics of a jester. You also gain proficiency with brewer's supplies
      if you don't already have it.
    </p>

    <h3>Drunken Technique</h3>
    <p>
      At 3rd level, you learn how to twist and turn quickly as part of your Flurry of Blows. Whenever you use Flurry of Blows, you gain the
      benefit of the Disengage action, and your walking speed increases by 10 feet until the end of the current turn.
    </p>

    <h3>Tipsy Sway</h3>
    <p>Starting at 6th level, you can move in sudden, swaying ways. You gain the following benefits.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Leap to Your Feet.</strong> When you're prone, you can stand up by spending 5 feet of movement, rather than half your speed.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Redirect Attack.</strong> When a creature misses you with a melee attack roll, you can spend 1 ki point as a reaction to cause
        that attack to hit one creature of your choice, other than the attacker, that you can see within 5 feet of you.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Drunkard's Luck</h3>
    <p>
      Starting at 11th level, you always seem to get a lucky bounce at the right moment. When you make an ability check, an attack roll, or a
      saving throw and have disadvantage, you can spend 2 ki points to cancel the disadvantage for that roll.
    </p>

    <h3>Intoxicated Frenzy</h3>
    <p>
      At 17th level, you gain the ability to make an overwhelming number of attacks against a group of enemies. When you use your Flurry of Blows,
      you can make up to three additional attacks with it (up to a total of five Flurry of Blows attacks), provided that each Flurry of Blows
      attack targets a different creature this turn.
    </p>

    <h2 id="four-elements">Way of the Four Elements</h2>
    <p>
      You follow a monastic tradition that teaches you to harness the elements. When you focus your ki, you can align yourself with the forces of
      creation and bend the four elements to your will, using them as an extension of your body. Some members of this tradition dedicate
      themselves to a single element, but others weave the elements together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many monks of this tradition tattoo their bodies with representations of their ki powers, commonly imagined as coiling dragons, but also as
      phoenixes, fish, plants, mountains, and cresting waves.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Disciple of the Elements</h3>
    <p>
      When you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you learn magical disciplines that harness the power of the four elements. A discipline
      costs ki points each time you use it.
    </p>
    <p>
      You know the Elemental Attunement discipline and one other discipline of your choice. You learn one additional elemental discipline of your
      choice at 6th, 11th, and 17th level.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whenever you learn a new elemental discipline, you can also replace one elemental discipline that you already know with a different
      discipline.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Casting Elemental Spells.</strong> Some elemental disciplines allow you to cast spells. To cast one of these spells, you use its
      casting time and other rules, but you don't need to provide material components for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you reach 5th level in this class, you can spend additional ki points to increase the level of an elemental discipline spell that you
      cast, provided that the spell has an enhanced effect at a higher level, as Burning Hands does. The spell's level increases by 1 for each additional ki point you spend. For example, if you are a 5th-level monk and use Sweeping Cinder Strike to cast Burning Hands, you can spend 3 ki points to cast it as a 2nd-level spell (the discipline's base cost of 2 ki points plus 1).
    </p>
    <p>
      The maximum number of ki points you can spend to cast a spell in this way (including its base ki point cost and any additional ki points you
      spend to increase its level) is determined by your monk level, as shown in the Spells and Ki Points table.

    <h2 id="kensei">Way of the Kensei</h2>

    <h2 id="long-death">Way of the Long Death</h2>
    <p>
      Monks of the Way of the Long Death are obsessed with the meaning and mechanics of dying. They capture creatures and prepare elaborate
      experiments to capture, record, and understand the moments of their demise. They then use this knowledge to guide their understanding of
      martial arts, yielding a deadly fighting style.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Touch of Death</h3>
    <p>
      Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, your study of death allows you to extract vitality from another creature as it nears
      its demise. When you reduce a creature within 5 feet of you to 0 hit points, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Wisdom modifier +
      your monk level (minimum of 1 temporary hit point).
    </p>
    
    <h3>Hour of Reaping</h3>
    <p>
      At 6th level, you gain the ability to unsettle or terrify those around you as an action, for your soul has been touched by the shadow of
      death. When you take this action, each creature within 30 feet of you that can see you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be
      frightened of you until the end of your next turn.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Mastery of Death</h3>
    <p>
      Beginning at 11th level, you use your familiarity with death to escape its grasp. When you are reduced to 0 hit points, you can expend 1 ki
      point (no action required) to have 1 hit point instead.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Touch of the Long Death</h3>
    <p>
      Starting at 17th level, your touch can channel the energy of death into a creature. As an action, you touch one creature within 5 feet of
      you, and you expend 1 to 10 ki points. The target must make a Constitution saving throw, and it takes 2d10 necrotic damage per ki point
      spent on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
    </p>

    <h2 id="mercy">Way of Mercy</h2>
    <p>
      Monks of the Way of Mercy learn to manipulate the life force of others to bring aid to those in need. They are wandering physicians to the
      poor and hurt. However, to those beyond their help, they bring a swift end as an act of mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those who follow the Way of Mercy might be members of a religious order, administering to the needy and making grim choices rooted in
      reality rather than idealism. Some might be gentle-voiced healers, beloved by their communities, while others might be masked bringers of
      macabre mercies.
    </p>
    <p>
      The walkers of this way usually don robes with deep cowls, and they often conceal their faces with masks, presenting themselves as the
      faceless bringers of life and death.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Implements of Mercy</h3>
    <p>
      When you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in the Insight and Medicine skills, and you gain proficiency with the
      herbalism kit.
    </p>
    <p>
      You also gain a special mask, which you often wear when using the features of this subclass. You determine its appearance, or generate it
      randomly by rolling on the Merciful Mask table.
    </p>
    <table class="table table-striped">

    <h3>Hands of Healing</h3>
    <p>
      At 3rd level, your mystical touch can mend wounds. As an action, you can spend 1 ki point to touch a creature and restore a number of hit
      points equal to a roll of your Martial Arts die + your Wisdom modifier.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you use your Flurry of Blows, you can replace one of the unarmed strikes with a use of this feature without spending a ki point for the
      healing.
    </p>

    <h3>Hands of Harm</h3>
    <p>
      At 3rd level, you use your ki to inflict wounds. When you hit a creature with an unarmed strike, you can spend 1 ki point to deal extra
      necrotic damage equal to one roll of your Martial Arts die + your Wisdom modifier. You can use this feature only once per turn.
    </p>

    <h3>Physician's Touch</h3>
    <p>
      Starting at 6th level, you can administer even greater cures with a touch, and if you feel it's necessary, you can use your knowledge to
      cause harm.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you use Hands of Healing on a creature, you can also end one disease or one of the following conditions affecting the creature:
      blinded, deafened, paralyzed, poisoned, or stunned.
    </p>
    <p>When you use Hands of Harm on a creature, you can subject that creature to the poisoned condition until the end of your next turn.</p>

    <h3>Flurry of Healing and Harm</h3>
    <p>
      Starting at 11th level, you can now mete out a flurry of comfort and hurt. When you use Flurry of Blows, you can now replace each of the
      unarmed strikes with a use of your Hands of Healing, without spending ki points for the healing.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, when you make an unarmed strike with Flurry of Blows, you can use Hand of Harm with that strike without spending the ki point
      for Hands of Harm. You can still use Hands of Harm only once per turn.
    </p>

    <h3>Hand of Ultimate Mercy</h3>
    <p>
      By 17th level, your mastery of life energy opens the door to the ultimate mercy. As an action, you can touch the corpse of a creature that
      died within the past 24 hours and expend 5 ki points. The creature then returns to life, regaining a number of hit points equal to 4d10 +
      your Wisdom modifier. If the creature died while subject to any of the following conditions, it revives with them removed: blinded,
      deafened, paralyzed, poisoned, and stunned.
    </p>
    <p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>

    <h2 id="open-hand">Way of the Open Hand</h2>
    <p>
      Monks of the Way of the Open Hand are the ultimate masters of martial arts combat, whether armed or unarmed. They learn techniques to push
      and trip their opponents, manipulate ki to heal damage to their bodies, and practice advanced meditation that can protect them from harm.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Open Hand Technique</h3>
    <p>
      Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you can manipulate your enemy's ki when you harness your own. Whenever you hit a
      creature with one of the attacks granted by your Flurry of Blows, you can impose one of the following effects on that target:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>It must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.</li>
      <li>It must make a Strength saving throw. If it fails, you can push it up to 15 feet away from you.</li>
      <li>It can't take reactions until the end of your next turn.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Wholeness of Body</h3>
    <p>
      At 6th level, you gain the ability to heal yourself. As an action, you can regain hit points equal to three times your monk level. You must
      finish a long rest before you can use this feature again.
    </p>

    <h3>Tranquility</h3>
    <p>
      Beginning at 11th level, you can enter a special meditation that surrounds you with an aura of peace. At the end of a long rest, you gain
      the effect of a Sanctuary spell that lasts until the start of your next long rest (the spell can end early as normal). The saving throw DC
      for the spell equals 8 + your Wisdom modifier + your proficiency bonus.
    </p>

    <h3>Quivering Palm</h3>
    <p>
      At 17th level, you gain the ability to set up lethal vibrations in someone's body. When you hit a creature with an unarmed strike, you can
      spend 3 ki points to start these imperceptible vibrations, which last for a number of days equal to your monk level. The vibrations are
      harmless unless you use your action to end them. To do so, you and the target must be on the same plane of existence. When you use this
      action, the creature must make a Constitution saving throw. If it fails, it is reduced to 0 hit points. If it succeeds, it takes 10d10
      necrotic damage.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can have only one creature under the effect of this feature at a time. You can choose to end the vibrations harmlessly without using an
      action.
    </p>

    <h2 id="shadow">Way of Shadow</h2>
    <p>
      Monks of the Way of Shadow follow a tradition that values stealth and subterfuge. These monks might be called ninjas or shadowdancers, and
      they serve as spies and assassins. Sometimes the members of a ninja monastery are family members, forming a clan sworn to secrecy about
      their arts and missions. Other monasteries are more like thieves' guilds, hiring out their services to nobles, rich merchants, or anyone
      else who can pay their fees. Regardless of their methods, the heads of these monasteries expect the unquestioning obedience of their
      students.
    </p>

    <h3>Shadow Arts</h3>
    <p>
      Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you can use your ki to duplicate the effects of certain spells. As an action, you can
      spend 2 ki points to cast darkness, darkvision, pass without trace, or silence, without providing material components. Additionally, you
      gain the minor illusion cantrip if you don't already know it.
    </p>

    <h3>Shadow Step</h3>
    <p>
      At 6th level, you gain the ability to step from one shadow into another. When you are in dim light or darkness, as a bonus action you can
      teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space you can see that is also in dim light or darkness. You then have advantage on the first melee
      attack you make before the end of the turn.
    </p>

    <h3>Cloak of Shadows</h3>
    <p>
      By 11th level, you have learned to become one with the shadows. When you are in an area of dim light or darkness, you can use your action to
      become invisible. You remain invisible until you make an attack, cast a spell, or are in an area of bright light.
    </p>

    <h3>Opportunist</h3>
    <p>
      At 17th level, you can exploit a creature's momentary distraction when it is hit by an attack. Whenever a creature within 5 feet of you is
      hit by an attack made by a creature other than you, you can use your reaction to make a melee attack against that creature.
    </p>

    <h2 id="sun-soul">Way of the Sun Soul</h2>
    <p>
      Monks of the Way of the Sun Soul learn to channel their own life energy into searing bolts of light. They teach that meditation can unlock
      the ability to unleash the indomitable light shed by the soul of every living creature.
    </p>

    <h3>Radiant Sun Bolt</h3>
    <p>Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you can hurl searing bolts of magical radiance.</p>
    <p>
      You gain a new attack option that you can use with the Attack action. This special attack is a ranged spell attack with a range of 30 feet.
      You are proficient with it, and you add your Dexterity modifier to its attack and damage rolls. Its damage is radiant, and its damage die is
      a d4. This die changes as you gain monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the Monk table.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you take the Attack action on your turn and use this special attack as part of it, you can spend 1 ki point to make the special attack
      twice as a bonus action.
    </p>
    <p>When you gain the Extra Attack feature, this special attack can be used for any of the attacks you make as part of the Attack action.</p>

    <h3>Searing Arc Strike</h3>
    <p>
      At 6th level, you gain the ability to channel your ki into searing waves of energy. Immediately after you take the Attack action on your
      turn, you can spend 2 ki points to cast the Burning Hands spell as a bonus action.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can spend additional ki points to cast Burning Hands as a higher level spell. Each additional ki point you spend increases the spell's
      level by 1. The maximum number of ki points (2 plus any additional points) that you can spend on the spell equals half your monk level.
    </p>

    <h3>Searing Sunburst</h3>
    <p>
      At 11th level, you gain the ability to create an orb of light that erupts into a devastating explosion. As an action, you magically create
      an orb and hurl it at a point you choose within 150 feet, where it erupts into a sphere of radiant light for a brief but deadly instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each creature in that 20-foot-radius sphere must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 2d6 radiant damage. A creature doesn't need
