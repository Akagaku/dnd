    <h1>Fighter Archetype: Rune Knight</h1>
    <p>
      Rune Knights enhance their martial prowess using the supernatural power of runes, an ancient practice that originated with giants. Rune
      cutters can be found among any family of giants, and you likely learned your methods first or second hand from such a mystical artisan.
      Whether you found the giant's work carved into a hill or cave, learned of the runes from a sage, or met the giant in person, you studied the
      giant's craft and learned how to apply magic runes to empower your equipment.
    </p>

    <h2>Bonus Proficiencies</h2>
    <p>When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with smith's tools, and you learn to speak, read, and write Giant.</p>

    <h2>Rune Carver</h2>
    <p>
      Starting at 3rd level, you can use magic runes to enhance your gear. You learn two runes of your choice, from among the runes described
      below, and each time you gain a level in this class, you can replace one rune you know with a different one from this feature. When you
      reach certain levels in this class, you learn additional runes, as shown in the Runes Known table.
    </p>
    <table class="table table-striped">
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Fighter Level</th>

    <p>
      Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch a number of objects equal to the number of runes you know, and you inscribe a different rune
      onto each of the objects. To be eligible, an object must be a weapon, a suit of armor, a shield, a piece of jewelry, or something else you
      can wear or hold in a hand. Your rune remains on an object until you finish a long rest, and an object can bear only one of your runes at a
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following runes are available to you when you learn a rune. If a rune has a level requirement, you must be at least that level in this
      class to learn the rune. If a rune requires a saving throw, your Rune Magic save DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution
      modifier.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Cloud Rune.</strong> This rune emulates the deceptive magic used by some cloud giants. While wearing or carrying an object
        inscribed with this rune, you have advantage on Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks and Charisma (Deception) checks.
        <ul>
          <li>
            In addition, when you or a creature you can see within 30 feet of you is hit by an attack roll, you can use your reaction to invoke
            the rune and choose a different creature within 30 feet of you, other than the attacker. The chosen creature becomes the target of the
            attack, using the same roll. This magic can transfer the attack's effects regardless of the attack's range. Once you invoke this rune,
            you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Fire Rune.</strong> This rune's magic channels the masterful craftsmanship of great smiths. While wearing or carrying an object
        inscribed with this rune, your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses your proficiency with a tool.
        <ul>
          <li>
            In addition, when you hit a creature with an attack using a weapon, you can invoke the rune to summon fiery shackles: the target takes
            an extra 2d6 fire damage, and it must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be restrained for 1 minute. While restrained by the
            shackles, the target takes 2d6 fire damage at the start of each of its turns. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of
            each of its turns, banishing the shackles on a success. Once you invoke this rune, you can't do so again until you finish a short or
            long rest.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Frost Rune.</strong> This rune's magic evokes the might of those who survive in the wintry wilderness, such as frost giants. While
        wearing or carrying an object inscribed with this rune, you have advantage on Wisdom (Animal Handling) checks and Charisma (Intimidation)
        checks.
        <ul>
          <li>
            In addition, you can invoke the rune as a bonus action to increase your sturdiness. For 10 minutes, you gain a +2 bonus to all ability
            checks and saving throws that use Strength or Constitution. Once you invoke this rune, you can't do so again until you finish a short
            or long rest.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Stone Rune.</strong> This rune's magic channels the judiciousness associated with stone giants. While wearing or carrying an
        object inscribed with this rune, you have advantage on Wisdom (Insight) checks, and you have darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.
        <ul>
          <li>
            In addition, when a creature you can see ends its turn within 30 feet of you, you can use your reaction to invoke the rune and force
            the creature to make a Wisdom saving throw. Unless the save succeeds, the creature is charmed by you for 1 minute. While charmed in
            this way, the creature has a speed of 0 and is incapacitated, descending into a dreamy stupor. The creature repeats the saving throw
            at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. Once you invoke this rune, you can't do so again until you finish a
            short or long rest.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Hill Rune (7th Level or Higher).</strong> This rune's magic bestows a resilience reminiscent of a hill giant. While wearing or
        carrying an object that bears this rune, you have advantage on saving throws against being poisoned, and you have resistance against
        poison damage.
        <ul>
          <li>
            In addition, you can invoke the rune as a bonus action, gaining resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage for 1 minute.
            Once you invoke this rune, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Storm Rune (7th Level or Higher).</strong> Using this rune, you can glimpse the future like a storm giant seer. While wearing or
        carrying an object inscribed with this rune, you have advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks, and you can't be surprised as long as you
        aren't incapacitated.
        <ul>
          <li>
            In addition, you can invoke the rune as a bonus action to enter a prophetic state for 1 minute or until you're incapacitated. Until the
            state ends, when you or another creature you can see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, a saving throw, or an ability check,
            you can use your reaction to cause the roll to have advantage or disadvantage. Once you invoke this rune, you can't do so again until
            you finish a short or long rest.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Giant Might</h2>
    <p>
      At 3rd level, you have learned how to imbue yourself with the might of giants. As a bonus action, you magically gain the following benefits,
      which last for 1 minute:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        If you are smaller than Large, you become Large, along with anything you are wearing. If you lack the room to become Large, your size
        doesn't change.
      </li>
      <li>You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.</li>
      <li>
        Once on each of your turns, one of your attacks with a weapon or an unarmed strike can deal an extra 1d6 damage to a target on a hit.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Runic Shield</h2>
    <p>
      At 7th level, you learn to invoke your rune magic to protect your allies. When another creature you can see within 60 feet of you is hit by
      an attack roll, you can use your reaction to force the attacker to reroll the d20 and use the new roll.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
    </p>

    <h2>Great Stature</h2>
    <p>
      By 10th level, the magic of your runes permanently alters you. When you gain this feature, roll 3d4. You grow a number of inches in height
      equal to the roll.
    </p>
    <p>Moreover, the extra damage you deal with your Giant's Might feature increases to 1d8.</p>

    <h2>Master of Runes</h2>
    <p>
      At 15th level, you can invoke each rune you know from your Rune Carver feature twice, rather than once, and you regain all expended uses
      when you finish a short or long rest.
    </p>

    <h2>Runic Juggernaut</h2>
    <p>
      At 18th level, you learn how to amplify your rune-powered transformation. As a result, the extra damage you deal with the Giant's Might
      feature increases to 1d10. Moreover, when you use that feature, your size can increase to Huge, and while you are that size, your reach
      increases by 5 feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long
      rest.
