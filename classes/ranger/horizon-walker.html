    <h1>Ranger: Horizon Walker Conclave</h1>
    <p>
      Horizon walkers guard the world against threats that originate from other planes or that seek to ravage the mortal realm with otherworldly
      magic. They seek out planar portals and keep watch over them, venturing to the Inner Planes and the Outer Planes as needed to pursue their
      foes. These rangers are also friends to any forces in the multiverse—especially benevolent dragons, fey, and elementals—that work to
      preserve life and the order of the planes.
    </p>

    <h2>Horizon Walker Magic</h2>
    <p>
      Starting at 3rd level, you learn an additional spell when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Horizon Walker Spells
      table. The spell counts as a ranger spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of ranger spells you know.
    </p>
    <table class="table table-striped">
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Ranger Level</th>
          <th>Spells</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>

        </tr>
        <tr>

          <td>Haste</td>
        </tr>

    <h2>Detect Portal</h2>
    <p>
      At 3rd level, you gain the ability to magically sense the presence of a planar portal. As an action, you detect the distance and direction
      to the closest planar portal within 1 mile of you.
    </p>
    <p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
    <p>See the "Planar Travel" section in chapter 2 of the Dungeon Master's Guide for examples of planar portals.</p>

    <h2>Planar Warrior</h2>
    <p>At 3rd level, you learn to draw on the energy of the multiverse to augment your attacks.</p>
    <p>
      As a bonus action, choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The next time you hit that creature on this turn with a weapon
      attack, all damage dealt by the attack becomes force damage, and the creature takes an extra 1d8 force damage from the attack. When you
      reach 11th level in this class, the extra damage increases to 2d8.
    </p>

    <h2>Ethereal Step</h2>
    <p>
      At 7th level, you learn to step through the Ethereal Plane. As a bonus action on your turn, you can cast the Etherealness spell with this
      feature, without expending a spell slot, but the spell ends at the end of the current turn.
    </p>
    <p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>

    <h2>Distant Strike</h2>
    <p>
      At 11th level, you gain the ability to pass between the planes in a blink of an eye. When you use the Attack action, you can teleport up to
      10 feet before each attack to an unoccupied space you can see.
    </p>
    <p>If you attack at least two different creatures with the action, you can make one additional attack with it against a third creature.</p>

    <h2>Spectral Defense</h2>
    <p>
      At 15th level, your ability to move between planes enables you to slip through the planar boundaries to lessen the harm done to you during
      battle. When you take damage from an attack, you can use your reaction to give yourself resistance to all of that attack's damage on this
      turn.
