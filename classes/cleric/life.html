    <h1>Cleric: Life Domain</h1>
    <p>
      The Life domain focuses on the vibrant positive energy—one of the fundamental forces of the universe—that sustains all life. The gods of
      life promote vitality and health through healing the sick and wounded, caring for those in need, and driving away the forces of death and
      undeath. Almost any non-evil deity can claim influence over this domain, particularly agricultural deities, sun gods , gods of healing or
      endurance, and gods of home and community.
    </p>

    <h2>Bonus Proficiency</h2>
    <p>When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain proficiency with heavy armor.</p>

    <h2>Discipline of Life</h2>
    <p>
      Also starting at 1st level, your healing spells are more effective. Whenever you use a spell of 1st level or higher to restore hit points
      to a creature, the creature regains additional hit points equal to 2 + the spell's level.
    </p>

    <h2>Channel Divinity: Preserve Life</h2>
    <p>Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to heal the badly injured.</p>
    <p>
      As an action, you present your holy symbol and evoke healing energy that can restore a number of hit points equal to five times your
      cleric level. Choose any creatures within 30 feet of you, and divide those hit points among them. This feature can restore a creature to
      no more than half of its hit point maximum. You can't use this feature on an undead or a construct.
    </p>

    <h2>Blessed Healer</h2>
    <p>
      Beginning at 6th level, the healing spells you cast on others heal you as well. When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that restores
      hit points to a creature other than you, you regain hit points equal to 2 + the spell's level.
    </p>

    <h2>Divine Strike</h2>
    <p>
      At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature
      with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 radiant damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra
      damage increases to 2d8.
    </p>

    <h2>Supreme Healing</h2>
    <p>
      Starting at 17th level, when you would normally roll one or more dice to restore hit points with a spell, you instead use the highest
      number possible for each die. For example, instead of restoring 2d6 hit points to a creature, you restore 12.
