    <h1>Cleric: Death Domain</h1>
    <p>
      The Death domain is concerned with the forces that cause death, as well as the negative energy that gives rise to undead creatures.
      Deities such as Chemosh, Myrkul, and Wee Jas are patrons of necromancers, death knights, liches, mummy lords, and vampires. Gods of the
      Death domain also embody murder, pain, disease or poison, and the underworld.
    </p>

    <h2>Bonus Proficiencies</h2>
    <p>When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain proficiency with martial weapons.</p>

    <h2>Reaper</h2>
    <p>
      At 1st level, you learn one necromancy cantrip of your choice from any spell list. When you cast a necromancy cantrip that normally
      targets only one creature, the spell can instead target two creatures within range and within 5 feet of each other.
    </p>

    <h2>Channel Divinity: Touch of Death</h2>
    <p>
      Starting at 2nd level, you can use Channel Divinity to destroy another creature's life force by touch. When you hit a creature with a
      melee attack, you can use Channel Divinity to deal extra necrotic damage to the target. The damage equals 5 + twice your cleric level.
    </p>

    <h2>Inescapable Destruction</h2>
    <p>
      Starting at 6th level, your ability to channel negative energy becomes more potent. Necrotic damage dealt by your cleric spells and
      Channel Divinity options ignores resistance to necrotic damage.
    </p>

    <h2>Divine Strike</h2>
    <p>
      At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with necrotic energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature
      with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an a 1d8 necrotic damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage
      increases to 2d8.
    </p>

    <h2>Improved Reaper</h2>
    <p>
      Starting at 17th level, when you cast a necromancy spell of 1st through 5th level that targets only one creature, the spell can instead
      target two creatures within range and within 5 feet of each other. If the spell consumes its material components, you must provide them
      for each target.
