    <h1>Magus</h1>
    <p>
      Magi are mystical warriors who blend martial prowess with esoteric knowledge and spellcasting. They balance the pursuit of personal goals and relationships with their obligations to the goals and ideals of the eldritch societies to which they belong. Although their backgrounds may at times set them at odds with one another, magi are united by their commitment to a cause greater than themselves and a drive to master their magical abilities.

    <ul>
      <li>(a) a simple weapon and a shield, (b) any melee martial weapon, or (c) a longbow and 20 arrows</li>
      <li>(a) leather armor or (b) scale mail</li>
      <li>(a) an arcane focus, (b) a druidic focus, or (c) a component pouch</li>
      <li>an explorer's pack</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="eldritch-society">Eldritch Society</h2>
    <p>
      At 1st level, you choose an eldritch society that trained you in the ways of the magus. Choose the <a href="magus/arcane-order.html">Arcane Order</a>, the <a href="magus/knights-of-the-stygian.html">Knights of the Stygian</a>, the <a href="magus/primordial-seal.html">Primordial Seal</a>, the <a href="magus/shadow-court.html">Shadow Court</a>, the <a href="magus/sidereal-cabal.html">Sidereal Cabal</a>, or the <a href="magus/sylvan-circle.html">Sylvan Circle</a>. The society you choose grants you features at 1st level and again at 3rd, 7th, and 14th level. Your choice also determines your spell list and spellcasting ability.
    </p>

    <h2 id="esoteric-eye">Esoteric Eye</h2>
    <p>
      Also at 1st level, you can sense the magic abilities of those around you. As an action, your eyes glow briefly with a magical light. You immediately learn whether each creature you can see within 60 feet of you knows any spells or can cast spells innately. You also learn each creature's spellcasting ability score, if it has one.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
    </p>

    <h2 id="mystic-mark">Mystic Mark</h2>
    <p>
      Starting at 2nd level, you learn to weave arcane energy into a magic, runic symbol. This mystic mark is unique to you, and has different effects depending on where it is placed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Aegis.</strong> As a bonus action, you project your mystic mark onto a creature you can see within 30 feet of you. For 1 minute, the target is under the protection of your aegis, and receives a +1 bonus to its armor class. This effect ends if the creature is ever more than 60 feet away from you. A creature can only benefit from one aegis at a time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The armor class bonus provided by your aegis increases to +2 when you reach 9th level, and to +3 when you reach 13th level.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Enspell.</strong> As a bonus action, you emblazon your mystic mark upon a weapon you are holding, enspelling it for 1 minute. You can use an enspelled weapon as a spellcasting focus, and it gains a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls. This effect ends if you are no longer holding the weapon. A weapon can only benefit from one enspell at a time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bonus to attack and damage rolls increases to +2 when you reach 9th level, and to +3 when you reach 13th level.
    </p>

    <h2 id="spellcasting">Spellcasting</h2>
    <p>
      An event in your past, or in the life of a parent or ancestor, left an indelible mark on you, infusing you with arcane magic. This font of
      magic, whatever its origin, fuels your spells.
    </p>

    <h3>Cantrips</h3>
    <p>
      At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from your eldritch society's spell list. You learn additional cantrips of your choice at
      higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Magus table.
    </p>

    <h3>Spell Slots</h3>
    <p>
      The Magus table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these
      spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, if you know the 1st-level spell burning hands and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast burning
      hands using either slot.
    </p>

    <h3>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</h3>
    <p>You know three 1st-level spells of your choice from your eldritch society's spell list.</p>
    <p>
      The Spells Known column of the Magus table shows when you learn more spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a
      level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the spells you know and replace it with another spell from
      your eldritch society's spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
    </p>

    <h3>Spellcasting Ability</h3>
    <p>
      Your spellcasting ability is determined by your eldritch society. See the Initiate feature of your eldritch society for your spellcasting ability.
    </p>

    <h3>Spellcasting Focus</h3>
    <p>
      Your spellcasting focus is determined by your eldritch society. See the Initiate feature of your eldritch society to see what, if any, spellcasting focus you may use for your spells.
    </p>

    <h2 id="eldritch-armament">Eldritch Armament</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        At 3rd level, you learn to infuse your preferred weapon or shield with magical power. Choose one of the following options.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Eldritch Archer.</strong> When you hit a creature with an enspelled ranged weapon, you can expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher cause the ammunition to explode with mystical energy. The target of your ranged attack and each creature within 10 feet of it must make a Dexterity saving throw. A target takes 2d4 force damage + 1d4 per each spell slot level above 1st (to a maximum of 6d4) on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Mystic Marauder.</strong> When you hit a creature with an enspelled melee weapon you are wielding with two hands, you can expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher to strengthen your strike. The target of your attack takes an extra 2d6 damage + 1d6 for each spell slot level above 1st.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Sorcerous Sentinel.</strong> While using a shield, when a creature under the effect of your aegis is attacked, you can use your reaction and expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher to bolster its defenses. The affected creature gains a bonus to its armor class equal to the spell slot level expended until the start of its next turn.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Spellsword.</strong> When you hit a creature with an enspelled one-handed melee weapon, you can expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher to strike at your opponent's weakpoint. The target takes an extra 1d4 force damage + 1d4 for each spell slot level above 1st, and has disadvantage on any saving throws made to resist your spells until the end of your next turn.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Ability Score Improvement</h2>
    <p>
      When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can
      increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.
    </p>

    <h2 id="mystic-meditation">Mystic Meditation</h2>
    <p>
      Starting at 6th level, you can choose to recover all expended uses of your Mystic Mark when taking a short rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      You must complete a long rest before you can use this feature again.
    </p>

    <h2 id="war-magic">War Magic</h2>
    <p>
      Starting at 7th level, when you use your action to cast a cantrip, you can make one weapon attack as a bonus action.
    </p>

    <h2 id="spell-surge">Spell Surge</h2>
    <p>
      Starting at 10th level, you can cast any spell you know without expending a spell slot. The spell is cast as if you had expended the highest level spell slot available to you from the magus class.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you use this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can use it again. When you reach 17th level, you can use this feature twice between long rests.
    </p>

    <h2 id="improved-war-magic">Improved War Magic</h2>
    <p>
      Starting at 11th level, when you use your action to cast a spell of 1st level or higher, you can make one weapon attack as a bonus action.
    </p>

    <h2 id="spell-ward">Spell Ward</h2>
    <p>
      Starting at 15th level, the magic of your enemies unravels around you. You and all allies within 15 feet of you have advantage on saving throws against spells.
    </p>

    <h2 id="greater-spell-surge">Greater Spell Surge</h2>
    <p>
      At 18th level, choose one 6th-level spell from your eldritch society's spell list. You can cast that spell once as a 6th-level spell without expending a spell slot.
