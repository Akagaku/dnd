      <strong>Hit Points at 1st Level:</strong> 10 + your Constitution modifier<br>

      <strong>Skills:</strong> Choose three from Animal Handling, Athletics, Insight, Investigation, Nature, Perception, Stealth, and Survival
    </p>
    <h3>Equipment</h3>
    <p>You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>(a) scale mail or (b) leather armor</li>
      <li>(a) two shortswords or (b) two simple melee weapons</li>
      <li>(a) a dungeoneer's pack or (b) an explorer's pack</li>
      <li>A longbow and a quiver of 20 arrows</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="favored-enemy">Favored Enemy</h2>
    <p>Beginning at 1st level, you have significant experience studying, tracking, hunting, and even talking to a certain type of enemy.</p>
    <p>
      Choose a type of favored enemy: aberrations, beasts, celestials, constructs, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, giants, monstrosities, oozes,
      plants, or undead. Alternatively, you can select two races of humanoid (such as gnolls and orcs) as favored enemies.
    </p>
    <p>
      You have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track your favored enemies, as well as on Intelligence checks to recall information about
      them.
    </p>
    <p>When you gain this feature, you also learn one language of your choice that is spoken by your favored enemies, if they speak one at all.</p>
    <p>
      You choose one additional favored enemy, as well as an associated language, at 6th and 14th level. As you gain levels, your choices should
      reflect the types of monsters you have encountered on your adventures.
    </p>

    <h2 id="natural-explorer">Natural Explorer</h2>
    <p>
      Also at 1st level, you are particularly familiar with one type of natural environment and are adept at traveling and surviving in such
      regions. Choose one type of favored terrain: arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, swamp, or the Underdark. When you make an
      Intelligence or Wisdom check related to your favored terrain, your proficiency bonus is doubled if you are using a skill that you're
      proficient in.
    </p>
    <p>While traveling for an hour or more in your favored terrain, you gain the following benefits:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Difficult terrain doesn't slow your group's travel.</li>
      <li>Your group can't become lost except by magical means.</li>
      <li>
        Even when you are engaged in another activity while traveling (such as foraging, navigating, or tracking), you remain alert to danger.
      </li>
      <li>If you are traveling alone, you can move stealthily at a normal pace.</li>
      <li>When you forage, you find twice as much food as you normally would.</li>
      <li>While tracking other creatures, you also learn their exact number, their sizes, and how long ago they passed through the area.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You choose additional favored terrain types at 6th and 10th level.</p>

    <h2 id="fighting-style">Fighting Style</h2>
    <p>
      You adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more
      than once, even if you later get to choose again.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Archery.</strong> You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Blind Fighting.</strong> You have blindsight with a range of 10 feet. Within that range, you can effectively see anything that
        isn't behind total cover, even if you're blinded or in darkness. Moreover, you can see an invisible creature within that range, unless the
        creature successfully hides from you.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Defense.</strong> While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Dueling.</strong> When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with
        that weapon.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Great Weapon Fighting.</strong> When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are
        wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the
        two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Interception.</strong> When a creature you can see hits a target, other than you, within 5 feet of you with an attack, you can use
        your reaction to reduce the damage the target takes by 1d10 + your proficiency bonus (to a minimum of 0 damage). You must be wielding a
        shield or a simple or martial weapon to use this reaction.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Protection.</strong> When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your
        reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Superior Technique.</strong> You learn one maneuver of your choice from among those available to the Battle Master archetype. If a
        maneuver you use requires your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver's effects, the saving throw DC equals 8 + your
        proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice).
        <ul>
          <li>
            You gain one superiority die, which is a d6 (this die is added to any superiority dice you have from another source). This die is used
            to fuel your maneuvers. A superiority die is expended when you use it. You regain your expended superiority dice when you finish a
            short or long rest.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Thrown Weapon Fighting.</strong> You can draw a weapon that has the thrown property as part of the attack you make with the weapon.
        <ul>
          <li>In addition, when you hit with a ranged attack using a thrown weapon, you gain a +2 bonus to the damage roll.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Two-Weapon Fighting.</strong> When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the
        second attack.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Unarmed Fighting.</strong> Your unarmed strikes can deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier on a hit. If you
        aren't wielding any weapons or a shield when you make the attack roll, the d6 becomes a d8.
        <ul>
          <li>At the start of each of your turns, you can deal 1d4 bludgeoning damage to one creature grappled by you.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="spellcasting">Spellcasting</h2>
    <p>By the time you reach 2nd level, you have learned to use the magical essence of nature to cast spells, much as a druid does.</p>

    <h3>Spell Slots</h3>
    <p>
      The Ranger table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your ranger spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you
      must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, if you know the 1st-level spell Animal Friendship and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast
      Animal Friendship using either slot.
    </p>

    <h3>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</h3>
    <p>You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the ranger spell list.</p>
    <p>
      The Spells Known column of the Ranger table shows when you learn more ranger spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level
      for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the ranger spells you know and replace it with another spell from
      the ranger spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
    </p>

    <h3>Spellcasting Ability</h3>
    <p>
      Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your ranger spells, since your magic draws on your attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever
      a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a ranger spell
      you cast and when making an attack roll with one.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Spell save DC =</strong> 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
    <p><strong>Spell attack modifier =</strong> your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>

    <h2 id="primeval-awareness">Primeval Awareness</h2>
    <p>
      Beginning at 3rd level, you can use your action and expend one ranger spell slot to focus your awareness on the region around you. For 1
      minute per level of the spell slot you expend, you can sense whether the following types of creatures are present within 1 mile of you (or
      within up to 6 miles if you are in your favored terrain): aberrations, celestials, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead. This
      feature doesn't reveal the creatures' location or number.
    </p>

    <h2 id="ranger-conclave">Ranger Conclave</h2>
    <p>
      At 3rd level, you choose to emulate the ideals and training of a ranger conclave. Choose <a href="#beast-master">Beast Master</a>,
      <a href="#fey-wanderer">Fey Wanderer</a>, <a href="#gloom-stalker">Gloom Stalker</a>, <a href="#horizon-walker">Horizon Walker</a>,
      <a href="#hunter">Hunter</a>, <a href="#monster-slayer">Monster Slayer</a>, <a href="#swarmkeeper">Swarmkeeper</a>, or
      <a href="#drakewarden">Drakewarden</a>. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at
      7th, 11th, and 15th level.
    </p>

    <h2>Ability Score Improvement</h2>
    <p>
      When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can
      increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.
    </p>

    <h2 id="extra-attack">Extra Attack</h2>
    <p>Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p>

    <h2 id="lands-stride">Land's Stride</h2>
    <p>
      Starting at 8th level, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants
      without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such as those
      created by the Entangle spell.
    </p>

    <h2 id="hide-in-plain-sight">Hide in Plain Sight</h2>
    <p>
      Starting at 10th level, you can spend 1 minute creating camouflage for yourself. You must have access to fresh mud, dirt, plants, soot, and
      other naturally occurring materials with which to create your camouflage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you are camouflaged in this way, you can try to hide by pressing yourself up against a solid surface, such as a tree or wall, that is
      at least as tall and wide as you are. You gain a +10 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) checks as long as you remain there without moving or
      taking actions. Once you move or take an action or a reaction, you must camouflage yourself again to gain this benefit.
    </p>

    <h2 id="vanish">Vanish</h2>
    <p>
      Starting at 14th level, you can use the Hide action as a bonus action on your turn. Also, you can't be tracked by nonmagical means, unless
      you choose to leave a trail.
    </p>

    <h2 id="feral-senses">Feral Senses</h2>
    <p>
      At 18th level, you gain preternatural senses that help you fight creatures you can't see. When you attack a creature you can't see, your
      inability to see it doesn't impose disadvantage on your attack rolls against it.
    </p>
    <p>
      You are also aware of the location of any invisible creature within 30 feet of you, provided that the creature isn't hidden from you and you
      aren't blinded or deafened.
    </p>

    <h2 id="foe-slayer">Foe Slayer</h2>
    <p>
      At 20th level, you become an unparalleled hunter of your enemies. Once on each of your turns, you can add your Wisdom modifier to the attack
      roll or the damage roll of an attack you make against one of your favored enemies. You can choose to use this feature before or after the
      roll, but before any effects of the roll are applied.
    </p>
