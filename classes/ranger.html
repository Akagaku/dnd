    <h1>Ranger</h1>
    <p>
      Far from the bustle of cities and towns, past the hedges that shelter the most distant farms from the terrors of the wild, amid the
      dense-packed trees of trackless forests and across wide and empty plains, rangers keep their unending watch.
    </p>
    <p><em>You must have a Dexterity score and a Wisdom score of 13 or higher in order to multiclass in or out of this class.</em></p>

    <h1>Class Features</h1>
    <p>As a ranger, you gain the following class features.</p>

    <h3>Hit Points</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Hit Dice:</strong> 1d20 per ranger level<br>
      <strong>Hit Points at 1st Level:</strong> 10 + your Constitution modifier<br>
      <strong>Hit Points at Higher Levels:</strong> 1d10 (or 6)+ your Constitution modifier<br>
    </p>
    <h3>Proficiencies</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Armor:</strong> Light armor, medium armor, shields<br>
      <strong>Weapons:</strong> Simple weapons, martial weapons<br>
      <strong>Tools:</strong> None<br>
      <strong>Saving Throws:</strong> Strength, Dexterity<br>
      <strong>Skills:</strong> Choose three from Animal Handling, Athletics, Insight, Investigation, Nature, Perception, Stealth, and Survival
    </p>
    <h3>Equipment</h3>
    <p>You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>(a) scale mail or (b) leather armor</li>
      <li>(a) two shortswords or (b) two simple melee weapons</li>
      <li>(a) a dungeoneer's pack or (b) an explorer's pack</li>
      <li>a longbow and a quiver of 20 arrows</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="favored-enemy">Favored Enemy</h2>
    <p>Beginning at 1st level, you have significant experience studying, tracking, hunting, and even talking to a certain type of enemy.</p>
    <p>
      Choose a type of favored enemy: aberrations, beasts, celestials, constructs, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, giants, monstrosities, oozes,
      plants, or undead. Alternatively, you can select two races of humanoid (such as gnolls and orcs) as favored enemies.
    </p>
    <p>
      You have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track your favored enemies, as well as on Intelligence checks to recall information about
      them.
    </p>
    <p>When you gain this feature, you also learn one language of your choice that is spoken by your favored enemies, if they speak one at all.</p>
    <p>
      You choose one additional favored enemy, as well as an associated language, at 6th and 14th level. As you gain levels, your choices should
      reflect the types of monsters you have encountered on your adventures.
    </p>

    <h2 id="natural-explorer">Natural Explorer</h2>
    <p>
      Also at 1st level, you are particularly familiar with one type of natural environment and are adept at traveling and surviving in such
      regions. Choose one type of favored terrain: arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, swamp, or the Underdark. When you make an
      Intelligence or Wisdom check related to your favored terrain, your proficiency bonus is doubled if you are using a skill that you're
      proficient in.
    </p>
    <p>While traveling for an hour or more in your favored terrain, you gain the following benefits:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Difficult terrain doesn't slow your group's travel.</li>
      <li>Your group can't become lost except by magical means.</li>
      <li>
        Even when you are engaged in another activity while traveling (such as foraging, navigating, or tracking), you remain alert to danger.
      </li>
      <li>If you are traveling alone, you can move stealthily at a normal pace.</li>
      <li>When you forage, you find twice as much food as you normally would.</li>
      <li>While tracking other creatures, you also learn their exact number, their sizes, and how long ago they passed through the area.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You choose additional favored terrain types at 6th and 10th level.</p>

    <h2 id="fighting-style">Fighting Style</h2>
    <p>
      You adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more
      than once, even if you later get to choose again.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Archery.</strong> You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Blind Fighting.</strong> You have blind sight with a range of 10 feet. Within that range, you can effectively see anything that
        isn't behind total cover, even if you're blinded or in darkness. Moreover, you can see an invisible creature within that range, unless the
        creature successfully hides from you.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Defense.</strong> While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Druidic Warrior.</strong> You learn two cantrips of your choice from the Druid spell list. They count as ranger spells for you,
        and Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for them. Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of these cantrips with
        another cantrip from the Druid spell list.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Dueling.</strong> When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with
        that weapon.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Thrown Weapon Fighting.</strong> You can draw a weapon that has the thrown property as part of the attack you make with the
        weapon. In addition, when you hit with a ranged attack using a thrown weapon, you gain a +2 bonus to the damage roll.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Two-Weapon Fighting.</strong> When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the
        second attack.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="spellcasting">Spellcasting</h2>
    <p>By the time you reach 2nd level, you have learned to use the magical essence of nature to cast spells, much as a druid does.</p>

    <h3>Spell Slots</h3>
    <p>
      The Ranger table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your ranger spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you
      must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, if you know the 1st-level spell Animal Friendship and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast
      Animal Friendship using either slot.
    </p>

    <h3>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</h3>
    <p>You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the ranger spell list.</p>
    <p>
      The Spells Known column of the Ranger table shows when you learn more ranger spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level
      for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the ranger spells you know and replace it with another spell from
      the ranger spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
    </p>

    <h3>Spellcasting Ability</h3>
    <p>
      Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your ranger spells, since your magic draws on your attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever
      a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a ranger spell
      you cast and when making an attack roll with one.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Spell save DC =</strong> 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
    <p><strong>Spell attack modifier =</strong> your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>

    <h2 id="primeval-awareness">Primeval Awareness</h2>
    <p>
      Beginning at 3rd level, you can use your action and expend one ranger spell slot to focus your awareness on the region around you. For 1
      minute per level of the spell slot you expend, you can sense whether the following types of creatures are present within 1 mile of you (or
      within up to 6 miles if you are in your favored terrain): aberrations, celestials, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead. This
      feature doesn't reveal the creatures' location or number.
    </p>

    <h2 id="ranger-conclave">Ranger Conclave</h2>
    <p>
      At 3rd level, you choose to emulate the ideals and training of a ranger conclave. Choose <a href="#beast-master">Beast Master</a>,
      <a href="#fey-wanderer">Fey Wanderer</a>, <a href="#gloom-stalker">Gloom Stalker</a>, <a href="#horizon-walker">Horizon Walker</a>,
      <a href="#hunter">Hunter</a>, <a href="#monster-slayer">Monster Slayer</a>, <a href="#swarmkeeper">Swarmkeeper</a>, or
      <a href="#drakewarden">Drakewarden</a>. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at
      7th, 11th, and 15th level.
    </p>

    <h2>Ability Score Improvement</h2>
    <p>
      When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can
      increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.
    </p>

    <h2 id="extra-attack">Extra Attack</h2>
    <p>Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p>

    <h2 id="lands-stride">Land's Stride</h2>
    <p>
      Starting at 8th level, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants
      without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such as those
      created by the Entangle spell.
    </p>

    <h2 id="hide-in-plain-sight">Hide in Plain Sight</h2>
    <p>
      Starting at 10th level, you can spend 1 minute creating camouflage for yourself. You must have access to fresh mud, dirt, plants, soot, and
      other naturally occurring materials with which to create your camouflage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you are camouflaged in this way, you can try to hide by pressing yourself up against a solid surface, such as a tree or wall, that is
      at least as tall and wide as you are. You gain a +10 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) checks as long as you remain there without moving or
      taking actions. Once you move or take an action or a reaction, you must camouflage yourself again to gain this benefit.
    </p>

    <h2 id="vanish">Vanish</h2>
    <p>
      Starting at 14th level, you can use the Hide action as a bonus action on your turn. Also, you can't be tracked by nonmagical means, unless
      you choose to leave a trail.
    </p>

    <h2 id="feral-senses">Feral Senses</h2>
    <p>
      At 18th level, you gain preternatural senses that help you fight creatures you can't see. When you attack a creature you can't see, your
      inability to see it doesn't impose disadvantage on your attack rolls against it.
    </p>
    <p>
      You are also aware of the location of any invisible creature within 30 feet of you, provided that the creature isn't hidden from you and you
      aren't blinded or deafened.
    </p>

    <h2 id="foe-slayer">Foe Slayer</h2>
    <p>
      At 20th level, you become an unparalleled hunter of your enemies. Once on each of your turns, you can add your Wisdom modifier to the attack
      roll or the damage roll of an attack you make against one of your favored enemies. You can choose to use this feature before or after the
      roll, but before any effects of the roll are applied.
    </p>

    <h1>Ranger Conclaves</h1>
    <h2 id="beast-master">Beast Master Conclave</h2>
    <p>
      The Beast Master archetype embodies a friendship between the civilized races and the beasts of the world. United in focus, beast and ranger
      work as one to fight the monstrous foes that threaten civilization and the wilderness alike. Emulating the Beast Master archetype means
      committing yourself to this ideal, working in partnership with an animal as its companion and friend.
    </p>

    <h3>Ranger's Companion</h3>
    <p>
      At 3rd level, you gain a beast companion that accompanies you on your adventures and is trained to fight alongside you. Choose a beast that
      is no larger than Medium and that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower (appendix D presents statistics for the hawk, mastiff, and panther
      as examples). Add your proficiency bonus to the beast's AC, attack rolls, and damage rolls, as well as to any saving throws and skills it is
      proficient in. Its hit point maximum equals its normal maximum or four times your ranger level, whichever is higher. Like any creature, the
      beast can spend Hit Dice during a short rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The beast obeys your commands as best as it can. It takes its turn on your initiative. On your turn, you can verbally command the beast
      where to move (no action required by you). You can use your action to verbally command it to take the Attack, Dash, Disengage, or Help
      action. If you don't issue a command, the beast takes the Dodge action. Once you have the Extra Attack feature, you can make one weapon
      attack yourself when you command the beast to take the Attack action. While traveling through your favored terrain with only the beast, you
      can move stealthily at a normal pace.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are incapacitated or absent, the beast acts on its own, focusing on protecting you and itself. The beast never requires your command
      to use its reaction, such as when making an opportunity attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the beast dies, you can obtain another one by spending 8 hours magically bonding with another beast that isn't hostile to you, either the
      same type of beast as before or a different one.
    </p>

    <h3>Exceptional Training</h3>
    <p>
      Beginning at 7th level, on any of your turns when your beast companion doesn't attack, you can use a bonus action to command the beast to
      take the Dash, Disengage, or Help action on its turn. In addition, the beast's attacks now count as magical for the purpose of overcoming
      resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.
    </p>

    <h3>Bestial Fury</h3>
    <p>
      Starting at 11th level, when you command your beast companion to take the Attack action, the beast can make two attacks, or it can take the
      Multiattack action if it has that action.
    </p>

    <h3>Share Spells</h3>
    <p>
      Beginning at 15th level, when you cast a spell targeting yourself, you can also affect your beast companion with the spell if the beast is
      within 30 feet of you.
    </p>
    
    <h2 id="fey-wanderer">Fey Wanderer Conclave</h2>
    <p>
      A fey mystique surrounds you, thanks to the boon of an archfey, the shining fruit you ate from a talking tree, the magic spring you swam in,
      or some other auspicious event. However you acquired your fey magic, you are now a Fey Wanderer, a ranger who represents both the mortal and
      the fey realms. As you wander the multiverse, your joyful laughter brightens the hearts of the downtrodden, and your martial prowess strikes
      terror in your foes, for great is the mirth of the fey and dreadful is their fury.
    </p>

    <h3>Dreadful Strikes</h3>
    <p>
      At 3rd level, you can augment your weapon strikes with mind-scarring magic, drawn from the gloomy hollows of the Feywild. When you hit a
      creature with a weapon, you can deal an extra 1d4 psychic damage to the target, which can take this extra damage only once per turn.
    </p>
    <p>The extra damage increases to 1d6 when you reach 11th level in this class.</p>

    <h3>Fey Wanderer Magic</h3>
    <p>
      Also at 3rd level, you learn an additional spell when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Fey Wanderer Spells table.
      Each spell counts as a ranger spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of ranger spells you know.
    </p>
    <table class="table table-striped">

      determine it randomly.

      </tbody>
    </table>

    <h3>Otherworldly Glamour</h3>
    <p>
      Additionally at 3rd level, your fey qualities give you a supernatural charm. As a result, whenever you make a Charisma check, you gain a
      bonus to the check equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of +1).
    </p>
    <p>In addition, you gain proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: Deception, Performance, or Persuasion.</p>

    <h3>Beguiling Twist</h3>
    <p>
      Beginning at 7th level, the magic of the Feywild guards your mind. You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, whenever you or a creature you can see within 120 feet of you succeeds on a saving throw against being charmed or frightened,
      you can use your reaction to force a different creature you can see within 120 feet of you to make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell
      save DC. If the save fails, the target is charmed or frightened by you (your choice) for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at
      the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a successful save.
    </p>

    <h3>Fey Reinforcements</h3>
    <p>
      At 11th level, the royal courts of the Feywild have blessed you with the assistance of fey beings: you know the spell Summon Fey. It doesn't
      count against the number of ranger spells you know, and you can cast it without a material component. You can also cast it once without
      using a spell slot, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whenever you start casting the spell, you can modify it so that it doesn't require concentration. If you do so, the spell's duration becomes
      1 minute for that casting.
    </p>

    <h3>Misty Wanderer</h3>
    <p>
      When you reach 15th level, you can slip in and out of the Feywild to move in a blink of an eye: you can cast Misty Step without expending a
      spell slot. You can do so a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish
      a long rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, whenever you cast Misty Step, you can bring along one willing creature you can see within 5 feet of you. That creature
      teleports to an unoccupied space of your choice within 5 feet of your destination space.
    </p>

    <h2 id="gloom-stalker">Gloom Stalker Conclave</h2>
    <p>
      Gloom stalkers are at home in the darkest places: deep under the earth, in gloomy alleyways, in primeval forests, and wherever else the
      light dims. Most folk enter such places with trepidation, but a gloom stalker ventures boldly into the darkness, seeking to ambush threats
      before they can reach the broader world. Such rangers are often found in the Underdark, but they will go any place where evil lurks in the
      shadows.
    </p>

    <h3>Gloom Stalker Magic</h3>
    <p>
      Starting at 3rd level, you learn an additional spell when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Gloom Stalker Spells
      table. The spell counts as a ranger spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of ranger spells you know.

    <h3>Dread Ambusher</h3>
    <p>At 3rd level, you master the art of the ambush. You can give yourself a bonus to your initiative rolls equal to your Wisdom modifier.</p>
    <p>
      At the start of your first turn of each combat, your walking speed increases by 10 feet, which lasts until the end of that turn. If you take
      the Attack action on that turn, you can make one additional weapon attack as part of that action. If that attack hits, the target takes an
      extra 1d8 damage of the weapon's damage type.
    </p>

    <h3>Umbral Sight</h3>
    <p>
      At 3rd level, you gain darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision from your race, its range increases by 30 feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      You are also adept at evading creatures that rely on darkvision. While in darkness, you are invisible to any creature that relies on
      darkvision to see you in that darkness.
    </p>

    <h3>Iron Mind</h3>
    <p>
      By 7th level, you have honed your ability to resist the mind-altering powers of your prey. You gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws. If
      you already have this proficiency, you instead gain proficiency in Intelligence or Charisma saving throws (your choice).
    </p>

    <h3>Stalker's Flurry</h3>
    <p>
      At 11th level, you learn to attack with such unexpected speed that you can turn a miss into another strike. Once on each of your turns when
      you miss with a weapon attack, you can make another weapon attack as part of the same action.
    </p>

    <h3>Shadowy Dodge</h3>
    <p>
      Starting at 15th level, you can dodge in unforeseen ways, with wisps of supernatural shadow around you. Whenever a creature makes an attack
      roll against you and doesn't have advantage on the roll, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on it. You must use this feature
      before you know the outcome of the attack roll.
    </p>

    <h2 id="horizon-walker">Horizon Walker Conclave</h2>
    <p>
      Horizon walkers guard the world against threats that originate from other planes or that seek to ravage the mortal realm with otherworldly
      magic. They seek out planar portals and keep watch over them, venturing to the Inner Planes and the Outer Planes as needed to pursue their
      foes. These rangers are also friends to any forces in the multiverse—especially benevolent dragons, fey, and elementals—that work to
      preserve life and the order of the planes.
    </p>

    <h3>Horizon Walker Magic</h3>
    <p>
      Starting at 3rd level, you learn an additional spell when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Horizon Walker Spells
      table. The spell counts as a ranger spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of ranger spells you know.

    <h3>Detect Portal</h3>
    <p>
      At 3rd level, you gain the ability to magically sense the presence of a planar portal. As an action, you detect the distance and direction
      to the closest planar portal within 1 mile of you.
    </p>
    <p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
    <p>See the "Planar Travel" section in chapter 2 of the Dungeon Master's Guide for examples of planar portals.</p>

    <h3>Planar Warrior</h3>
    <p>At 3rd level, you learn to draw on the energy of the multiverse to augment your attacks.</p>
    <p>
      As a bonus action, choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The next time you hit that creature on this turn with a weapon
      attack, all damage dealt by the attack becomes force damage, and the creature takes an extra 1d8 force damage from the attack. When you
      reach 11th level in this class, the extra damage increases to 2d8.
    </p>

    <h3>Ethereal Step</h3>
    <p>
      At 7th level, you learn to step through the Ethereal Plane. As a bonus action on your turn, you can cast the Etherealness spell with this
      feature, without expending a spell slot, but the spell ends at the end of the current turn.
    </p>
    <p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>

    <h3>Distant Strike</h3>
    <p>
      At 11th level, you gain the ability to pass between the planes in a blink of an eye. When you use the Attack action, you can teleport up to
      10 feet before each attack to an unoccupied space you can see.
    </p>
    <p>If you attack at least two different creatures with the action, you can make one additional attack with it against a third creature.</p>

    <h3>Spectral Defense</h3>
    <p>
      At 15th level, your ability to move between planes enables you to slip through the planar boundaries to lessen the harm done to you during
      battle. When you take damage from an attack, you can use your reaction to give yourself resistance to all of that attack's damage on this
      turn.
    </p>

    <h2 id="hunter">Hunter Conclave</h2>
    <p>
      Some rangers seek to master weapons to better protect civilization from the terrors of the wilderness. Members of the Hunter Conclave learn
      specialized fighting techniques for use against the most dire threats, from rampaging ogres and hordes of orcs to towering giants and
      terrifying dragons.
    </p>

    <h3>Hunter's Prey</h3>
    <p>At 3rd level, you gain one of the following features of your choice.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Colossus Slayer.</strong> Your tenacity can wear down the most potent foes. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, the

      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Giant Killer.</strong> When a Large or larger creature within 5 feet of you hits or misses you with an attack, you can use your
        reaction to attack that creature immediately after its attack, provided that you can see the creature.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Horde Breaker.</strong> Once on each of your turns when you make a weapon attack, you can make another attack with the same weapon

    </ul>
    
    <h3>Defensive Tactics</h3>

      <li>
        <strong>Whirlwind Attack.</strong> You can use your action to make melee attacks against any number of creatures within 5 feet of you,

        <strong>Evasion.</strong> When you are subjected to an effect, such as a red dragon's fiery breath or a lightning bolt spell, that allows

    <h2 id="monster-slayer">Monster Slayer Conclave</h2>
    <p>
      You have dedicated yourself to hunting down creatures of the night and wielders of grim magic. A monster slayer seeks out vampires, dragons,
      evil fey, fiends, and other magical threats. Trained in supernatural techniques to overcome such monsters, slayers are experts at unearthing
      and defeating mighty, mystical foes.
    </p>

    <h3>Monster Slayer Magic</h3>
    <p>
      Starting at 3rd level, you learn an additional spell when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Monster Slayer Spells
      table. The spell counts as a ranger spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of ranger spells you know.
    </p>

    <h3>Hunter's Sense</h3>
    <p>
      At 3rd level, you gain the ability to peer at a creature and magically discern how best to hurt it. As an action, choose one creature you
      can see within 60 feet of you. You immediately learn whether the creature has any damage immunities, resistances, or vulnerabilities and
      what they are. If the creature is hidden from divination magic, you sense that it has no damage immunities, resistances, or vulnerabilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses of it when you
      finish a long rest.
    </p>

    <h3>Slayer's Prey</h3>
    <p>
      Starting at 3rd level, you can focus your ire on one foe, increasing the harm you inflict on it. As a bonus action, you designate one
      creature you can see within 60 feet of you as the target of this feature. The first time each turn that you hit that target with a weapon
      attack, it takes an extra 1d6 damage from the weapon.
    </p>
    <p>This benefit lasts until you finish a short or long rest. It ends early if you designate a different creature.</p>

    <h3>Supernatural Defense</h3>
    <p>
      At 7th level, you gain extra resilience against your prey's assaults on your mind and body. Whenever the target of your Slayer's Prey
      forces you to make a saving throw and whenever you make an ability check to escape that target's grapple, add 1d6 to your roll.
    </p>

    <h3>Magic-User's Nemesis</h3>
    <p>
      At 11th level, you gain the ability to thwart someone else's magic. When you see a creature casting a spell or teleporting within 60 feet
      of you, you can use your reaction to try to magically foil it. The creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save
      DC, or its spell or teleport fails and is wasted.
    </p>
    <p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>

    <h3>Slayer's Counter</h3>
    <p>
      At 15th level, you gain the ability to counterattack when your prey tries to sabotage you. If the target of your Slayer's Prey forces you
      to make a saving throw, you can use your reaction to make one weapon attack against the quarry. You make this attack immediately before
      making the saving throw. If the attack hits, your save automatically succeeds, in addition to the attack's normal effects.
    </p>

    <h2 id="drakewarden">Drakewarden Conclave</h2>
    <p>
      Your connection to the natural world takes the form of a draconic spirit, which can manifest in physical form as a drake. As your powers
      grow, your drake grows as well, blossoming from a small four-legged companion to a majestic winged creature large and strong enough for you
      to ride. Along the way, you gain an increasing share of the awe-inspiring power of dragons.
    </p>
    <p>Consider the source of the draconic spirit you have bonded with. The Drakewarden Origin table offers examples.</p>

        </tr>
      </tbody>

    <h3>Draconic Gift</h3>
    <p>
      At 3rd level, the bond you share with your drake creates a connection to dragonkind, granting you understanding and empowering your
      presence.
    </p>
    <p>You gain the following benefits:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Thaumaturgy.</strong> You learn the Thaumaturgy cantrip, which is a ranger spell for you.</li>
      <li><strong>Tongue of Dragons.</strong> You learn to speak, read, and write Draconic or one other language of your choice.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Drake Companion</h3>
    <p>
      At 3rd level, as an action, you can magically summon the drake that is bound to you. It appears in an unoccupied space of your choice
      within 30 feet of you.
    </p>
    <p>
      The drake is friendly to you and your companions, and it obeys your commands. See its game statistics in the accompanying Drake Companion
      stat block, which uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places. Whenever you summon the drake, choose a damage type listed in its
      Draconic Essence trait. You can determine the cosmetic characteristics of the drake, such as its color, its scale texture, or any visible
      effect of its Draconic Essence; your choice has no effect on its game statistics.
    </p>
    <p>
      In combat, the drake shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It can move and use its reaction on its
      own, but the only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take
      another action. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. If you are incapacitated, the drake can take any action of
      its choice, not just Dodge.
    </p>
    <p>
      The drake remains until it is reduced to 0 hit points, until you use this feature to summon the drake again, or until you die. Anything the
      drake was wearing or carrying is left behind when the drake vanishes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you summon the drake, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher to
      summon it.

    <h3>Bond of Fang and Scale</h3>
    <p>
      At 7th level the bond you share with your drake intensifies, protecting you and stoking the drake's fury. When you summon your drake, it
      grows wings on its back and gains a flying speed equal to its walking speed.
    </p>
    <p>In addition, while your drake is summoned, you and the drake gain the following benefits:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Drake Mount.</strong> The drake grows to Medium size. Reflecting your special bond, you can use the drake as a mount if your size
        is Medium or smaller. While you are riding your drake, it can't use the flying speed of this feature.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Magic Fang.</strong> The drake's Bite attack deals an extra 1d6 damage of the type chosen for the drake's Draconic Essence.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Resistance.</strong> You gain resistance to the damage type chosen for the drakes Draconic Essence.
      </li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Drake's Breath</h3>
    <p>
      At 11th level, as an action, you can exhale a 30-foot cone of damaging breath or cause your drake to exhale it. Choose acid, cold, fire,
      lightning, or poison damage (your choice doesn't have to match your drake's Draconic Essence). Each creature in the cone must make a
      Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC, taking 8d6 damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
    </p>
    <p>This damage increases to 10d6 when you reach 15th level in this class.</p>
    <p>
      Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a spell slot of 3rd level or higher to use
      it again.
    </p>

    <h3>Perfected Bond</h3>
    <p>
      At 15th level, your bond to your drake reaches the pinnacle of its power. While your drake is summoned, you and the drake gain the
      following benefits:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Empowered Bite.</strong> The drake's Bite attack deals an extra 1d6 damage of the type chosen for its Draconic Essence (for a
        total of 2d6 extra damage).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Large Drake.</strong> The drake grows to Large size. When you ride your drake, it is no longer prohibited from using the flying
        speed of Bond of Fang and Scale.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Reflexive Resistance.</strong> When either you or the drake takes damage while you're within 30 feet of each other, you can use
        your reaction to give yourself or the drake resistance to that instance of damage. You can use this reaction a number of times equal to
        your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
