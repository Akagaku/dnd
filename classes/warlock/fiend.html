    <h1>Warlock: The Fiend</h1>
    <p>
      You have made a pact with a fiend from the lower planes of existence, a being whose aims are evil, even if you strive against those aims.
      Such beings desire the corruption or destruction of all things, ultimately including you.
    </p>

    <h2>Expanded Spell List</h2>
    <p>
      The Fiend lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock
      spell list for you.
    </p>
    <table class="table table-striped">
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Spell Level</th>
          <th>Spells</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>1st</td>
          <td>Burning Hands, Command</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>2nd</td>
          <td>Blindness/Deafness, Scorching Ray</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>3rd</td>
          <td>Fireball, Stinking Cloud</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>4th</td>
          <td>Fire Shield, Wall of Fire</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>5th</td>
          <td>Flame Strike, Hallow</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2>Dark One's Blessing</h2>
    <p>
      Starting at 1st level, when you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Charisma modifier +
      your warlock level (minimum of 1).
    </p>

    <h2>Dark One's Own Luck</h2>
    <p>
      Starting at 6th level, you can call on your patron to alter fate in your favor. When you make an ability check or a saving throw, you can
      use this feature to add a d10 to your roll. You can do so after seeing the initial roll but before any of the roll's effects occur.
    </p>
    <p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>

    <h2>Fiendish Resilience</h2>
    <p>
      Starting at 10th level, you can choose one damage type when you finish a short or long rest. You gain resistance to that damage type until
      you choose a different one with this feature. Damage from magical weapons or silver weapons ignores this resistance.
    </p>

    <h2>Hurl Through Hell</h2>
    <p>
      Starting at 14th level, when you hit a creature with an attack, you can use this feature to instantly transport the target through the
      lower planes. The creature disappears and hurtles through a nightmare landscape.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of your next turn, the target returns to the space it previously occupied, or the nearest unoccupied space. If the target is not
      a fiend, it takes 10d10 psychic damage as it reels from its horrific experience.
    </p>
    <p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>
