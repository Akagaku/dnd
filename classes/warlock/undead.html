    <h1>Warlock: The Undead</h1>
    <p>
      You've made a pact with a deathless being, a creature that defies the cycle and life and death, forsaking its mortal shell so it might
      eternally pursue its unfathomable ambitions. For such beings, time and morality are fleeting things, the concerns of those for whom grains
      of sand still rush through life's hourglass. Having once been mortal themselves, these ancient undead know firsthand the paths of ambition
      and the routes past the doors of death. They eagerly share this profane knowledge, along with other secrets, with those who work their will
      among the living.
    </p>

    <h2>Expanded Spell List</h2>
    <p>
      At 1st level, the Undead lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to
      the warlock spell list for you.
    </p>
    <table class="table table-striped">
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Spell Level</th>
          <th>Spells</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>1st</td>
          <td>Bane, False Life</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>2nd</td>
          <td>Blindness/Deafness, Phantasmal Force</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>3rd</td>
          <td>Phantom Steed, Speak with Dead</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>4th</td>
          <td>Death Ward, Greater Invisibility</td>
        </tr>

          <td>Antilife Shell, Cloudkill</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2>Form of Dread</h2>
    <p>
      At 1st level, you manifest an aspect of your patron's dreadful power. As a bonus action, you transform for 1 minute. You gain the following
      benefits while transformed:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>You gain temporary hit points equal to 1d10 + your warlock level.</li>
      <li>
        Once during each of your turns, when you hit a creature with an attack, you can force it to make a Wisdom saving throw, and if the saving
        throw fails, the target is frightened of you until the end of your next turn.
      </li>
      <li>You are immune to the frightened condition.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can transform a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>
    <p>
      The appearance of your Form of Dread reflects some aspect of your patron. For example, your form could be a shroud of shadows forming the
      crown and robes of your lich patron, or your body might glow with glyphs from ancient funerary rites and be surrounded by desert winds,
      suggesting your mummy patron.
    </p>

    <h2>Grave Touched</h2>
    <p>At 6th level, your patron's powers have a profound effect on your body and magic. You don't need to eat, drink, or breathe.</p>
    <p>
      In addition, once during each of your turns, when you hit a creature with an attack and roll damage against the creature, you can replace
      the damage type with necrotic damage. While you are using your Form of Dread, you can roll one additional damage die when determining the
      necrotic damage the target takes.
    </p>

    <h2>Necrotic Husk</h2>
    <p>
      At 10th level, Your connection to undeath and necrotic energy now saturates your body. You have resistance to necrotic damage. If you are
      transformed using your Form of Dread, you instead become immune to necrotic damage.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, when you are reduced to 0 hit points, you can use your reaction to drop to 1 hit point instead and cause your body to erupt
      with deathly energy. Each creature of your choice that is within 30 feet of you takes necrotic damage equal to 2d10 + your warlock level.
      You then gain 1 level of exhaustion. Once you use this reaction, you can't do so again until you finish 1d4 long rests.
    </p>

    <h2>Spirit Projection</h2>
    <p>
      At 14th level, your spirit can become untethered from your physical form. As an action, you can project your spirit from your body. The
      body you leave behind is unconscious and in a state of suspended animation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your spirit resembles your mortal form in almost every way, replicating game statistics but not your possessions. Any damage or other
      effects that apply to your spirit or physical body affects the other. Your spirit can remain outside your body for up to 1 hour or until
      your concentration is broken (as if concentrating on a spell). When your projection ends, your spirit returns to your body or your body
      magically teleports to your spirit's space (your choice).
    </p>
    <p>While projecting your spirit, you gain the following benefits:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your spirit and body gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.</li>
      <li>
        When you cast a spell of the conjuration or necromancy school, the spell doesn't require verbal or somatic components or material
        components that lack a gold cost.
      </li>
      <li>
        You have a flying speed equal to your walking speed and can hover. You can move through creatures and objects as if they were difficult
        terrain, but you take 1d10 force damage if you end your turn inside a creature or an object.
      </li>
      <li>
        While you are using your Form of Dread, once during each of your turns when you deal necrotic damage to a creature, you regain hit points
        equal to half the amount of necrotic damage dealt.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.</p>
