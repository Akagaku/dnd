    <h1>Eldritch Invocations</h1>

    <h2 id="agonizing-blast">Agonizing Blast</h2>
    <p><strong><em>Prerequisite: Eldritch Blast cantrip</em></strong></p>
    <p>When you cast Eldritch Blast, add your Charisma modifier to the damage it deals on a hit.</p>

    <h2 id="armor-of-shadows">Armor of Shadows</h2>
    <p>You can cast mage armor on yourself at will, without expending a spell slot or material components.</p>

    <h2 id="ascendant-step">Ascendant Step</h2>
    <p><strong><em>Prerequisite: 9th level</em></strong></p>
    <p>You can cast Levitate on yourself at will, without expending a spell slot or material components.</p>
    
    <h2 id="aspect-of-the-moon">Aspect of the Moon</h2>
    <p><strong><em>Prerequisite: Pact of the Tome feature</em></strong></p>
    <p>
      You no longer need to sleep and can't be forced to sleep by any means. To gain the benefits of a long rest, you can spend all 8 hours doing
      light activity, such as reading your Book of Shadows and keeping watch.
    </p>
    
    <h2 id="beast-speech">Beast Speech</h2>
    <p>You can cast Speak with Animals at will, without expending a spell slot.</p>
    
    <h2 id="beguiling-influence">Beguiling Influence</h2>
    <p>You gain proficiency in the Deception and Persuasion skills.</p>
    
    <h2 id="bewitching-whispers">Bewitching Whispers</h2>
    <p><strong><em>Prerequisite: 7th level</em></strong></p>
    <p>You can cast compulsion once using a warlock spell slot. You can't do so again until you finish a long rest.</p>
    
    <h2 id="bond-of-the-talisman">Bond of the Talisman</h2>
    <p><strong><em>Prerequisite: 12th level, Pact of the Talisman feature</em></strong></p>
    <p>
      While someone else is wearing your talisman, you can use your action to teleport to the unoccupied space closest to them, provided the two
      of you are on the same plane of existence. The wearer of your talisman can do the same thing, using their action to teleport to you. The
      teleportation can be used a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and all expended uses are restored when you finish a long rest.
    </p>
    
    <h2 id="book-of-the-ancients">Book of Ancient Secrets</h2>
    <p><strong><em>Prerequisite: Pact of the Tome feature</em></strong></p>
    <p>
      You can now inscribe magical rituals in your Book of Shadows. Choose two 1st-level spells that have the ritual tag from any class's spell
      list (the two needn't be from the same list). The spells appear in the book and don't count against the number of spells you know. With your
      Book of Shadows in hand, you can cast the chosen spells as rituals. You can't cast the spells except as rituals, unless you've learned them
      by some other means. You can also cast a warlock spell you know as a ritual if it has the ritual tag.
    </p>
    <p>
      On your adventures, you can add other ritual spells to your Book of Shadows. When you find such a spell, you can add it to the book if the
      spell's level is equal to or less than half your warlock level (rounded up) and if you can spare the time to transcribe the spell. For each
      level of the spell, the transcription process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp for the rare inks needed to inscribe it.
    </p>
    
    <h2 id="chains-of-carceri">Chains of Carceri</h2>
    <p><strong><em>Prerequisite: 15th level, Pact of the Chain feature</em></strong></p>
    <p>
      You can cast hold monster at will—targeting a celestial, fiend, or elemental—without expending a spell slot or material components. You must
      finish a long rest before you can use this invocation on the same creature again.
    </p>
    
    <h2 id="cloak-of-flies">Cloak of Flies</h2>
    <p><strong><em>Prerequisite: 5th level</em></strong></p>
    <p>
      As a bonus action, you can surround yourself with a magical aura that looks like buzzing flies. The aura extends 5 feet from you in every
      direction, but not through total cover. It lasts until you're incapacitated or you dismiss it as a bonus action.
    </p>
    <p>
      The aura grants you advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks but disadvantage on all other Charisma checks. Any other creature that
      starts its turn in the aura takes poison damage equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 0 damage).
    </p>
    <p>Once you use this invocation, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
    
    <h2 id="devils-sight">Devil's Sight</h2>
    <p>You can see normally in darkness, both magical and nonmagical, to a distance of 120 feet.</p>
    
    <h2 id="dreadful-word">Dreadful Word</h2>
    <p><strong><em>Prerequisite: 7th level</em></strong></p>
    <p>You can cast Confusion once using a warlock spell slot. You can't do so again until you finish a long rest.</p>
    
    <h2 id="eldritch-mind">Eldritch Mind</h2>
    <p>You have advantage on Constitution saving throws that you make to maintain your concentration on a spell.</p>
    
    <h2 id="eldritch-sight">Eldritch Sight</h2>
    <p>You can cast Detect Magic at will, without expending a spell slot or material components.</p>
    
    <h2 id="eldritch-smite">Eldritch Smite</h2>
    <p><strong><em>Prerequisite: 5th level, Pact of the Blade feature</em></strong></p>
    <p>
      Once per turn when you hit a creature with your pact weapon, you can expend a warlock spell slot to deal an extra 1d8 force damage to the
      target, plus another 1d8 per level of the spell slot, and you can knock the target prone if it is Huge or smaller.
    </p>
    
    <h2 id="eldritch-spear">Eldritch Spear</h2>
    <p><strong><em>Prerequisite: Eldritch Blast cantrip</em></strong></p>

    <h2 id="eyes-of-the-rune-keeper">Eyes of the Rune Keeper</h2>
    <p>You can read all writing.</p>
    
    <h2 id="far-scribe">Far Scribe</h2>
    <p><strong><em>Prerequisite: 5th level, Pact of the Tome feature</em></strong></p>
    <p>
      A new page appears in your Book of Shadows. With your permission, a creature can use its action to write its name on that page, which can
      contain a number of names equal to your proficiency bonus.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can cast the Sending spell, targeting a creature whose name is on the page, without using a spell slot and without using material
      components. To do so, you must write the message on the page. The target hears the message in their mind, and if the target replies, their
      message appears on the page, rather than in your mind. The writing disappears after 1 minute.
    </p>
    <p>As an action, you can magically erase a name on the page by touching it.</p>
    
    <h2 id="fiendish-vigor">Fiendish Vigor</h2>
    <p>You can cast False Life on yourself at will as a 1st-level spell, without expending a spell slot or material components.</p>
    
    <h2 id="gaze-of-two-minds">Gaze of Two Minds</h2>
    <p>
      You can use your action to touch a willing humanoid and perceive through its senses until the end of your next turn. As long as the creature
      is on the same plane of existence as you, you can use your action on subsequent turns to maintain this connection, extending the duration
      until the end of your next turn. While perceiving through the other creature's senses, you benefit from any special senses possessed by that
      creature, and you are blinded and deafened to your own surroundings.
    </p>

    <h2 id="ghostly-gaze">Ghostly Gaze</h2>
    <p><strong><em>Prerequisite: 7th level</em></strong></p>
    <p>
      As an action, you gain the ability to see through solid objects to a range of 30 feet. Within that range, you have darkvision if you don't
      already have it. This special sight lasts for 1 minute or until your concentration ends (as if you were concentrating on a spell). During
      that time, you perceive objects as ghostly, transparent images.
    </p>
    <p>Once you use this invocation, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
    
    <h2 id="gift-of-the-depths">Gift of the Depths</h2>
    <p><strong><em>Prerequisite: 5th level</em></strong></p>
    <p>You can breathe underwater, and you gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.</p>
    <p>You can also cast Water Breathing without expending a spell slot. You regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest.</p>
    
    <h2 id="gift-of-the-ever-living-ones">Gift of the Ever-Living Ones</h2>
    <p><strong><em>Prerequisite: Pact of the Chain feature</em></strong></p>
    <p>
      Whenever you regain hit points while your familiar is within 100 feet of you, treat any dice rolled to determine the hit points you regain
      as having rolled their maximum value for you.
    </p>
    
    <h2 id="gift-of-the-protectors">Gift of the Protectors</h2>
    <p><strong><em>Prerequisite: 9th level, Pact of the Tome feature</em></strong></p>
    <p>
      A new page appears in your Book of Shadows. With your permission, a creature can use its action to write its name on that page, which can
      contain a number of names equal to your proficiency bonus.
    </p>
    <p>
      When any creature whose name is on the page is reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, the creature magically drops to 1 hit point
      instead. Once this magic is triggered, no creature can benefit from it until you finish a long rest.
    </p>
    <p>As an action, you can magically erase a name on the page by touching it.</p>
    
    <h2 id="grasp-of-hadar">Grasp of Hadar</h2>
    <p><strong><em>Prerequisite: Eldritch Blast cantrip</em></strong></p>
    <p>

    <p><strong><em>Prerequisite: Pact of the Blade feature</em></strong></p>
    <p>You can use any weapon you summon with your Pact of the Blade feature as a spellcasting focus for your warlock spells.</p>
    <p>
      In addition, the weapon gains a +1 bonus to its attack and damage rolls, unless it is a magic weapon that already has a bonus to those rolls.
    </p>
    <p>Finally, the weapon you conjure can be a shortbow, longbow, light crossbow, or heavy crossbow.</p>
    
    <h2 id="investment-of-the-chain-master">Investment of the Chain Master</h2>
    <p><strong><em>Prerequisite: Pact of the Chain feature</em></strong></p>
    <p>
      When you cast Find Familiar, you infuse the summoned familiar with a measure of your eldritch power, granting the creature the following
      benefits:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The familiar gains either a flying speed or a swimming speed (your choice) of 40 feet.</li>
      <li>As a bonus action, you can command the familiar to take the Attack action.</li>
      <li>The familiar's weapon attacks are considered magical for the purpose of overcoming immunity and resistance to nonmagical attacks.</li>
      <li>If the familiar forces a creature to make a saving throw, it uses your spell save DC.</li>
      <li>When the familiar takes damage, you can use your reaction to grant it resistance against that damage.</li>
