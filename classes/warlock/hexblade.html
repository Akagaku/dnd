    <h1>Warlock: The Hexblade</h1>
    <p>
      You have made your pact with a mysterious entity from the Shadowfellâ€”a force that manifests in sentient magic weapons carved from the
      stuff of shadow. The mighty sword Blackrazor is the most notable of these weapons, which have been spread across the multiverse over the
      ages. The shadowy force behind these weapons can offer power to warlocks who form pacts with it. Many hexblade warlocks create weapons that
      emulate those formed in the Shadowfell. Others forgo such arms, content to weave the dark magic of that plane into their spellcasting.
    </p>

    <h2>Expanded Spell List</h2>
    <p>
      The Hexblade lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock
      spell list for you.
    </p>
    <table class="table table-striped">
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Spell Level</th>
          <th>Spells</th>

    <h2>Hexblade's Curse</h2>
    <p>
      Starting at 1st level, you gain the ability to place a baleful curse on someone. As a bonus action, choose one creature you can see within
      30 feet of you. The target is cursed for 1 minute. The curse ends early if the target dies, you die, or you are incapacitated. Until the
      curse ends, you gain the following benefits:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>You gain a bonus to damage rolls against the cursed target. The bonus equals your proficiency bonus.</li>
      <li>Any attack roll you make against the cursed target is a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20.</li>
      <li>If the cursed target dies, you regain hit points equal to your warlock level + your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1 hit point).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can't use this feature again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>

    <h2>Hex Warrior</h2>
    <p>
      At 1st level, you acquire the training necessary to effectively arm yourself for battle. You gain proficiency with medium armor, shields,
      and martial weapons.
    </p>
    <p>
      The influence of your patron also allows you to mystically channel your will through a particular weapon. Whenever you finish a long rest,
      you can touch one weapon that you are proficient with and that lacks the two-handed property. When you attack with that weapon, you can use
      your Charisma modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, for the attack and damage rolls. This benefit lasts until you finish a long rest.
      If you later gain the Pact of the Blade feature, this benefit extends to every pact weapon you conjure with that feature, no matter the
      weapon's type.
    </p>

    <h2>Accursed Specter</h2>
    <p>
      Starting at 6th level, you can curse the soul of a person you slay, temporarily binding it in your service. When you slay a humanoid, you
      can cause its spirit to rise from its corpse as a specter. When the specter appears, it gains temporary hit points equal to half your
      warlock level. Roll initiative for the specter, which has its own turns. It obeys your verbal commands, and it gains a special bonus to its
      attack rolls equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of +0).
    </p>
    <p>The specter remains in your service until the end of your next long rest, at which point it vanishes to the afterlife.</p>
    <p>Once you bind a specter with this feature, you can't use the feature again until you finish a long rest.</p>

    <h2>Armor of Hexes</h2>
    <p>
      At 10th level, your hex grows more powerful. If the target cursed by your Hexblade's Curse hits you with an attack roll, you can use your
      reaction to roll a d6. On a 4 or higher, the attack instead misses you, regardless of its roll.
    </p>

    <h2>Master of Hexes</h2>
    <p>
      Starting at 14th level, you can spread your Hexblade's Curse from a slain creature to another creature. When the creature cursed by your
      Hexblade's Curse dies, you can apply the curse to a different creature you can see within 30 feet of you, provided you aren't
      incapacitated. When you apply the curse in this way, you don't regain hit points from the death of the previously cursed creature.
