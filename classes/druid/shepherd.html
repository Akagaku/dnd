    <h1>Druid: Circle of the Shepherd</h1>
    <p>
      Druids of the Circle of the Shepherd commune with the spirits of nature, especially the spirits of beasts and the fey, and call to those
      spirits for aid. These druids recognize that all living things play a role in the natural world, yet they focus on protecting animals and
      fey creatures that have difficulty defending themselves. Shepherds, as they are known, see such creatures as their charges. They ward off
      monsters that threaten them, rebuke hunters who kill more prey than necessary, and prevent civilization from encroaching on rare animal
      habitats and on sites sacred to the fey.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many of these druids are happiest far from cities and towns, content to spend their days in the company of animals and the fey creatures of
      the wilds. Members of this circle become adventurers to oppose forces that threaten their charges or to seek knowledge and power that will
      help them safeguard their charges better. Wherever these druids go, the spirits of the wilderness are with them.
    </p>

    <h2>Speech of the Woods</h2>
    <p>At 2nd level, you gain the ability to converse with beasts and many fey.</p>
    <p>
      You learn to speak, read, and write Sylvan. In addition, beasts can understand your speech, and you gain the ability to decipher their
      noises and motions. Most beasts lack the intelligence to convey or understand sophisticated concepts, but a friendly beast could relay what
      it has seen or heard in the recent past. This ability doesn't grant you any special friendship with beasts, though you can combine this
      ability with gifts to curry favor with them as you would with any nonplayer character.
    </p>

    <h2>Spirit Totem</h2>
    <p>Starting at 2nd level, you gain the ability to call forth nature spirits and use them to influence the world around you.</p>
    <p>
      As a bonus action, you can magically summon an incorporeal spirit to a point you can see within 60 feet of you. The spirit creates an aura
      in a 30-foot radius around that point. It counts as neither a creature nor an object, though it has the spectral appearance of the creature
      it represents. As a bonus action, you can move the spirit up to 60 feet to a point you can see.
    </p>
    <p>The spirit persists for 1 minute. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
    <p>The effect of the spirit's aura depends on the type of spirit you summon from the options below.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Bear Spirit.</strong> The bear spirit grants you and your allies its might and endurance. Each creature of your choice in the aura
      when the spirit appears gains temporary hit points equal to 5 + your druid level. In addition, you and your allies gain advantage on
      Strength checks and Strength saving throws while in the aura.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Hawk Spirit.</strong> The hawk spirit is a consummate hunter, aiding you and your allies with its keen sight. When a creature makes
      an attack roll against a target in the spirit's aura, you can use your reaction to grant advantage to that attack roll. In addition, you and
      your allies have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks while in the aura.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Unicorn Spirit.</strong> The unicorn spirit lends its protection to those nearby. You and your allies gain advantage on all ability
      checks made to detect creatures in the spirit's aura. In addition, if you cast a spell using a spell slot that restores hit points to any
      creature inside or outside the aura, each creature of your choice in the aura also regains hit points equal to your druid level.
    </p>

    <h2>Mighty Summoner</h2>
    <p>
      At 6th level, beasts and fey that you conjure are more resilient than normal. Any beast or fey summoned or created by a spell that you cast
      gains two benefits:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The creature appears with more hit points than normal: 2 extra hit points per Hit Die it has.</li>
      <li>
        The damage from its natural weapons is considered magical for the purpose of overcoming immunity and resistance to nonmagical attacks and
        damage.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Guardian Spirit</h2>
    <p>
      Beginning at 10th level, your Spirit Totem safeguards the beasts and fey that you call forth with your magic. When a beast or fey that you
      summoned or created with a spell ends its turn in your Spirit Totem aura, that creature regains a number of hit points equal to half your
      druid level.
    </p>

    <h2>Faithful Summons</h2>
    <p>
      Starting at 14th level, the nature spirits you commune with protect you when you are the most defenseless. If you are reduced to 0 hit
      points or are incapacitated against your will, you can immediately gain the benefits of Conjure Animals as if it were cast with a 9th-level
      spell slot. It summons four beasts of your choice that are challenge rating 2 or lower. The conjured beasts appear within 20 feet of you.
      If they receive no commands from you, they protect you from harm and attack your foes. The spell lasts for 1 hour, requiring no
      concentration, or until you dismiss it (no action required).
    </p>
    <p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>
