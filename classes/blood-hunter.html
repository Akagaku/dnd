    <h1>Blood Hunter</h1>
    <p>
      Blood hunters are clever warriors driven by an unending determination to destroy evils old and new. Armed with rites of secretive blood
      magic and a willingness to sacrifice their own vitality and humanity for their cause, they protect the realms from the shadows—even as they
      remain ever vigilant against being drawn to the darkness that consumes the monsters they hunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>
        You must have an Intelligence score of 13 or higher and a Strength or Dexterity score of 13 or higher in order to multiclass in or out of
        this class.

    <h1>Class Features</h1>
    <p>As a blood hunter, you gain the following class features.</p>

    <h3>Hit Points</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Hit Dice:</strong> 1d10 per blood hunter level<br>
      <strong>Hit Points at 1st Level:</strong> 10 + your Constitution modifier<br>
      <strong>Hit Points at Higher Levels:</strong> 1d10 (or 6) + your Constitution modifier<br>
    </p>
    <h3>Proficiencies</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Armor:</strong> Light armor, medium armor, shields<br>
      <strong>Weapons:</strong> Simple weapons, martial weapons<br>
      <strong>Tools:</strong> Alchemist's supplies<br>
      <strong>Saving Throws:</strong> Dexterity, Intelligence<br>
      <strong>Skills:</strong> Choose three from Acrobatics, Arcana, Athletics, History, Insight, Investigation, Religion, and Survival
    </p>
    <h3>Equipment</h3>
    <p>You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>(a) a martial weapon or (b) two simple weapons</li>
      <li>(a) a light crossbow and 20 bolts or (b) hand crossbow and 20 bolts</li>
      <li>(a) studded leather armor or (b) scale mail armor</li>
      <li>an explorer's pack and alchemist's supplies</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="hunters-bane">Hunter's Bane</h2>
    <p>
      At 1st level, you have survived the Hunter's Bane—a dangerous, long-guarded ritual that alters your life's blood, forever binding you to
      the darkness and honing your senses against it. You have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track fey, fiends, or undead, as well as
      on Intelligence checks to recall information about such creatures.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Hunter's Bane also empowers your body to control and shape hemocraft magic, using your own blood and life essence to fuel your
      abilities. Some of your features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature's effects. The saving throw DC is
      calculated as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Hemocraft save DC =</strong> 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Hemocraft modifier (your choice between Intelligence and Wisdom)
    </p>

    <h2 id="blood-maledict">Blood Maledict</h2>
    <p>
      Also at 1st level, you gain the ability to channel—or sometimes sacrifice—a part of your vital essence to curse and manipulate creatures
      through hemocraft magic. You know one Blood Curse of your choice. You learn one additional blood curse of your choice at 6th, 10th, 14th,
      and 18th level. Each time you learn a new blood curse, you can also choose one of the blood curses you know and replace it with another
      blood curse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each time you use your Blood Maledict feature, you choose which curse to invoke from the curses you know. While invoking a blood curse, but
      before it affects the target, you can choose to amplify the curse by taking necrotic damage equal to one roll of your hemocraft die. This
      damage can't be reduced in any way. An amplified curse gains an additional effect, noted in the curse's description. Creatures that do not
      have blood are immune to blood curses unless you have amplified the curse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again. You can use Blood Maledict twice between rests
      starting at 6th level, three times starting at 13th level, and four times starting at 17th level.
    </p>

    <h2 id="fighting-style">Fighting Style</h2>
    <p>
      At 2nd level, you adopt a style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option
      more than once, even if you later get to choose again.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Archery.</strong> You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Dueling.</strong> When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with
        that weapon.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Great Weapon Fighting.</strong> When you roll a 1 or 2 on a non-rite damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that
        you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile
        property for you to gain this benefit.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Two-Weapon Fighting.</strong> When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the
        second attack.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="crimson-rite">Crimson Rite</h2>
    <p>
      Also at 2nd level, you learn to invoke a rite of hemocraft that infuses your weapon strikes with elemental energy. As a bonus action, you
      can activate any rite you know on one weapon you're holding. The effect of the rite lasts until you finish a short or long rest. When you
      activate a rite, you take necrotic damage equal to one roll of your hemocraft die. This damage can't be reduced in any way.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the rite is in effect, attacks you make with this weapon are magical, and deal extra damage equal to your hemocraft die of the type
      determined by the chosen rite. A weapon can hold only one active rite at a time. Other creatures can't gain the benefit of your rite.
    </p>
    <p>
      You choose one rite from the crimson rites below when you first gain this feature. You learn an additional crimson rite at 7th level, and
      again at 14th level.
    </p>

    <h3>Crimson Rites</h3>
    <ul class="list-unstyled">
      <li><strong><em>Rite of the Flame.</em></strong> Your rite damage is fire damage.</li>
      <li><strong><em>Rite of the Frozen.</em></strong> Your rite damage is cold damage.</li>
      <li><strong><em>Rite of the Storm.</em></strong> Your rite damage is lightning damage.</li>
      <li><strong><em>Rite of the Dead.</em></strong> Your rite damage is necrotic damage. (Prerequisite: 14th level)</li>
      <li><strong><em>Rite of the Oracle.</em></strong> Your rite damage is psychic damage. (Prerequisite: 14th level)</li>
      <li><strong><em>Rite of the Roar.</em></strong> Your rite damage is thunder damage. (Prerequisite: 14th level)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="blood-hunter-order">Blood Hunter Order</h2>
    <p>
      At 3rd level, you commit to an order of blood hunters whose philosophy will guide you throughout your life. Choose
      <a href="blood-hunter/ghostslayer.html">Ghostslayer</a>, <a href="blood-hunter/lycan.html">Lycan</a>,
      <a href="blood-hunter/mutant.html">Mutant</a>, or <a href="blood-hunter/profane-soul.html">Profane Soul</a> The order you choose grants you
      features at 3rd level, and again at 7th, 11th, 15th, and 18th
      level.
    </p>

    <h2>Ability Score Improvement</h2>
    <p>
      When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can
      increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.
    </p>

    <h2 id="extra-attack">Extra Attack</h2>
    <p>Starting at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p>

    <h2 id="brand-of-castigation">Brand of Castigation</h2>
    <p>
      At 6th level, when you damage a creature with a weapon for which you have an active crimson rite, you can channel hemocraft magic to sear
      an arcane brand into that creature (no action required). You always know the direction to the branded creature as long as it's on the same
      plane of existence as you. Further, each time the branded creature deals damage to you or a creature you can see within 5 feet of you, the
      branded creature takes psychic damage equal to your Hemocraft modifier (minimum of 1).
    </p>
    <p>
      Your brand lasts until you dismiss it or until you use this feature to apply a brand to another creature. Your brand can be dispelled with
      Dispel Magic, and is treated as a spell with a level equal to half your blood hunter level (maximum 9th level).
    </p>
    <p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>

    <h2 id="grim-psychometry">Grim Psychometry</h2>
    <p>
      When you reach 9th level, you gain a supernatural talent for discerning the secrets surrounding mysterious relics or places touched by
      evil. Whenever you make an Intelligence (History) check to recall information about the sinister or tragic history of an object you are
      touching or your current location, you have advantage on the check. At the DM's discretion, a suitably high roll might cause your character
      to experience brief visions of the past connected to the object or location.
    </p>

    <h2 id="dark-augmentation">Dark Augmentation</h2>
    <p>
      Starting at 10th level, the magic of hemocraft suffuses your body to permanently reinforce your resilience. Your speed increases by 5 feet,
      and you have a bonus to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws equal to your Hemocraft modifier (minimum of +1).
    </p>

    <h2 id="brand-of-tethering">Brand of Tethering</h2>
    <p>
      Starting at 13th level, the psychic damage from your Brand of Castigation increases to twice your Hemocraft modifier (minimum of 2).
      Additionally, a branded creature can't take the Dash action, and if it attempts to teleport or to leave its current plane by any means, it
      takes 4d6 psychic damage and must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the attempt to teleport or leave the plane fails.
    </p>

    <h2 id="hardened-soul">Hardened Soul</h2>
    <p>When you reach 14th level, you have advantage on saving throws against being charmed and frightened.</p>

    <h2 id="sanguine-mastery">Sanguine Mastery</h2>
    <p>
      Upon reaching 20th level, your mastery of blood magic reaches its height, mitigating your sacrifice and empowering your expertise. Once per
      turn, whenever a blood hunter feature requires you to roll a hemocraft die, you can reroll the die and use either roll.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, whenever you score a critical hit with a weapon for which you have an active crimson rite, you regain one expended use of
      your Blood Maledict feature.
