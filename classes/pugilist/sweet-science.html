    <h1>Pugilist: The Sweet Science</h1>
    <p>
      Pugilists who practice the Sweet Science hit hard, fast, and often. This style is sometimes used by fighters who battle for the
      entertainment of the upper classes, but is just as often practiced in back alleys and bars by those whose next breath depends on a knockout.
    </p>

    <h2>Bare Knuckle Boxer</h2>
    <p>
      Starting when you choose this fight club at 3rd level, your unarmed strikes score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.
    </p>

    <h2>Cross Counter</h2>
    <p>
      Also starting at 3rd level, you can block the brunt of an attack and launch one of your own in the same fluid motion. When you take damage
      from a melee weapon attack, you can use your reaction and spend 2 moxie points to reduce the damage by 1d10 + your Strength modifier + your
      pugilist level.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the damage is reduced to 0, you can make an unarmed strike or pugilist weapon attack against the attacking creature as part of the same
      reaction.
    </p>

    <h2>One, Two, Three, Floor</h2>
    <p>
      Starting at 6th level, when you use your bonus action to use the Old One-Two and hit the same creature with both attacks, you can spend 1
      moxie point to make an additional unarmed strike against that creature as part of the same bonus action. If you hit, the creature takes
      damage as normal, and is also knocked prone.
    </p>

    <h2>Float Like a Butterfly</h2>
    <p>
      Starting at 11th level, when you hit a creature with your Cross Counter feature, you regain 1 expended moxie point.
    </p>

    <h2>Sting Like a Bee</h2>
    <p>
      Starting at 17th level, when you hit with an unarmed strike or pugilist weapon, you can spend 1 or more moxie points to try to knock out
      your opponent. For each moxie point spent, add 1d12 to your attack's damage.
