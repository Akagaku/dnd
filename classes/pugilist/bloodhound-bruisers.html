    <h1>Bloodhound Bruisers</h1>
    <p>
      Pugilists in the Bloodhound Bruisers fight club are notorious for looking for trouble and finding it every time. Members of this fight club are highly observant of character traits and physical evidence, and can form an almost supernatural connection to the cities they live in. Most use these abilities to become urban defenders of the downtrodden, but others lend their talents to less savory organizations.
    </p>

    <h2>Detective Work</h2>
    <p>
      When you choose thi fight club at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in two of the following skills of your choice: Insight, Investigation, and Perception. In addition, when you make an Intelligence (Investigation), Wisdom (Insight), or Wisdom (Perception) check, you can spend 1 moxie point to gain advantage on the check.
    </p>

    <h2>Ever Vigilant</h2>
    <p>
