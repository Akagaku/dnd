    <h1>Pugilist: The Squared Circle</h1>
    <p>
      Pugilists who fight in the Squared Circle know you don't have to knock an opponent senseless to get them to submit. Of course, members of
      the Squared Circle do beat their opponents senseless. They just know they don't have to.
    </p>

    <h2>Groundwork</h2>
    <p>
      Starting when you choose this fight club at 3rd level, you gain the following additional moxie features:
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Compression Lock.</strong> When a creature breaks your grapple, you can use your reaction and spend 1 moxie point to force the
      creature to roll again. It must use the second result.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Quick Pin.</strong> When a hostile creature's movement provokes an opportunity attack from you, you can use your reaction and spend
      1 moxie point to attempt to grapple the creature instead of making a normal opportunity attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>To the Mat.</strong> You can use a bonus action and spend 1 moxie point to make a Strength (Athletics) check with a DC equal to the
      armor class of one creature within 5 feet of you. On a success, you grapple that creature and knock it prone.
    </p>

    <h2>Muscle Mass</h2>
    <p>
      Also at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in the Athletics skill if you don't have it already. Whenever you make a Strength (Athletics) check
      as part of a pugilist class feature, or to grapple or shove a creature, your proficiency bonus is doubled for that check.
    </p>

    <h2>Meat Shield</h2>
    <p>
      Starting at 6th level, when you have an enemy creature grappled, you gain half cover against all attacks made against you by any creature
      you are not grappling. When an attack made by a creature you are not grappling misses you, you can use your reaction and spend 1 moxie point
      to have that creature make the same attack with a new roll against a creature you are grappling.
    </p>

    <h2>Heavyweight</h2>
    <p>
      Starting at 11th level, you count as being one size larger for the purposes of grappling and shoving. In addition, you can move your full
      movement speed when you are dragging or carrying a grappled creature of your size or smaller.
    </p>

    <h2>Clean Finish</h2>
    <p>
      At 17th level, your mastery of grappling reaches its peak. You have advantage on all attacks against creatures you're grappling.
      Additionally, when you make an unarmed strike or pugilist weapon attack against a creature you have grappled, you score a critical hit on a
      roll of 19 or 20.
