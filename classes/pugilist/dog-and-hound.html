    <h1>Dog and Hound</h1>
    <p>
      You've never had a friend you could rely on that walked on two legs. Luckily for you, you've got the best four-legged friend anyone could ask for. Pugilists in the Dog and Hound fight club are as faithful to their canine companions as their canine companions are to them.
    </p>

    <h2>Brawler's Best Friend</h2>
    <p>
      Starting when you choose this fight club at 3rd level, you agin a houn that accompanies you on your adventures and fights alongside you. It is friendly to you and your companions, and it obeys your commands. See its game statistics in the Hound stat block, which uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places. You determine what breed of dog, or similar canine creature, your hound is; your choice has no effect on its game statistics.
    </p>
    <p>
      In combat, the hound shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It can moce and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes on its turns is the Dodge action, unless you use a bonus action on your turn to command it to take another action. If you are incapacitated, the hound can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you spend 1 minute giving your hound attention and treats, it regains 2d6 hit points. If your hound has died within the last hour, you can revive it by coaxing it back from the threshold of the beyond. You can use an action to touch the hound and expend a number of Hit Dice equal to half your pugilist level to revive it, provided you are within 5 feet of it. The hound returns to life after 1 minute with all its hit points restored. If your hound dies or is otherwise unavailable to you, you can forge a bond with a dog over the course of 8 hours, making it your new hound and ending your connection to the previous one.
    </p>

    <h2>Mutt with Moxie</h2>
    <p>
      Starting at 3rd level, you share everything with your faithful hound: food, shelter, even moxie. When you use certain moxie abilities, your hound gains a benefit as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Brace Up.</strong> When you gain temporary hit points as a result of using this feature, your hound gains the same number of temporary hit points.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>The Old One-Two.</strong> When you use this feature, your hound can make one or both attacks instead of you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Stick and Move.</strong> Your hound can take the Dash action as part of the bonus action you make to use this feature.
    </p>

    <h2>Coordinated Attack</h2>
    <p>
      Starting at 6th level, you and your canine companion form a more potent fighting team. When you use the Attack action on your turn, if your hound can see you, it can use its reaction to make a bite attack.
    </p>

    <h2>Hound's Best Friend</h2>
    <p>
      Starting at 11th level, when a creature hits your hound with an attack, you can use your reaction to make an opportunity attack against that creature.
    </p>

    <h2>Off the Chain</h2>
    <p>
      Beginning at 17th level, your hound's spirit is as unbreakable as yours. When your hound takes damage that reduces its hit points to half its maximum hit points or less,  you can use your reaction to let your hound off the chain. When you do, it immediately gains temporary hit points equal to four times your pugilist level. For 1 minute, its speed is increased by 15 feet and it can take the bite or Dodge action (your choice) on each turn without you needing to use a bonus action to command it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
