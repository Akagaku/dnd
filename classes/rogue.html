    <h1>Class Features</h1>
    <p>As a rogue, you gain the following class features.</p>

    <h3>Hit Points</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Hit Dice:</strong> 1d8 per rogue level<br>
      <strong>Hit Points at 1st Level:</strong> 8 + your Constitution modifier<br>
      <strong>Hit Points at Higher Levels:</strong> 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier<br>
    </p>
    <h3>Proficiencies</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Armor:</strong> Light armor<br>
      <strong>Weapons:</strong> Simple weapons, hand crossbows, longswords, rapiers, shortswords<br>
      <strong>Tools:</strong> Rhieves' tools<br>
      <strong>Saving Throws:</strong> Dexterity, Intelligence<br>
      <strong>Skills:</strong> Choose four from Acrobatics, Athletics, Deception, Insight, Intimidation, Investigation, Perception, Performance,
      Persuasion, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth
    </p>
    <h3>Equipment</h3>
    <p>You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>(a) a rapier or (b) a shortswordv</li>
      <li>(a) a shortbow and quiver of 20 arrows or (b) a shortsword</li>
      <li>(a) a burglar's pack, (b) dungeoneer's pack, or (c) an explorer's pack</li>
      <li>leather armor, two daggers, and thieves' tools</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="expertise">Expertise</h2>
    <p>
      At 1st level, choose two of your skill proficiencies, or one of your skill proficiencies and your proficiency with thieves' tools. Your
      proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.
    </p>
    <p>At 6th level, you can choose two more of your proficiencies (in skills or with thieves' tools) to gain this benefit.</p>

    <h2 id="sneak-attack">Sneak Attack</h2>
    <p>
      Beginning at 1st level, you know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe's distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to
      one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon.
    </p>
    <p>
      You don't need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn't incapacitated, and you
      don't have disadvantage on the attack roll.
    </p>
    <p>The amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the Rogue table.</p>

    <h2 id="thieves-cant">Thieves' Cant</h2>
    <p>
      During your rogue training you learned thieves' cant, a secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages in
      seemingly normal conversation. Only another creature that knows thieves' cant understands such messages. It takes four times longer to
      convey such a message than it does to speak the same idea plainly.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, you understand a set of secret signs and symbols used to convey short, simple messages, such as whether an area is dangerous or
      the territory of a thieves' guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether the people in an area are easy marks or will provide a safe house for
      thieves on the run.
    </p>

    <h2 id="cunning-action">Cunning Action</h2>
    <p>
      Starting at 2nd level, your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly. You can take a bonus action on each of your turns
      in combat. This action can be used only to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action.
    </p>

    <h2 id="roguish-archetype">Roguish Archetype</h2>
    <p>
      At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you emulate in the exercise of your rogue abilities. Choose
      <a href="#arcane-trickster">Arcane Trickster</a>, <a href="#assassin">Assassin</a>, <a href="#inquisitive">Inquisitive</a>,
      <a href="#mastermind">Mastermind</a>, <a href="#phantom">Phantom</a>, <a href="#scout">Scout</a>, <a href="#soulknife">Soulknife</a>,
      <a href="#swashbuckler">Swashbuckler</a>, or <a href="#thief">Thief</a>. Your archetype choice grants you features at 3rd level and then
      again at 9th, 13th, and 17th level.
    </p>

    <h2>Ability Score Improvement</h2>
    <p>
      When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you
      can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.
    </p>

    <h2 id="uncanny-dodge">Uncanny Dodge</h2>
    <p>
      Starting at 5th level, when an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack's damage
      against you.
    </p>

    <h2 id="evasion">Evasion</h2>
    <p>
      Beginning at 7th level, you can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a red dragon's fiery breath or an Ice Storm
      spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no
      damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.
    </p>

    <h2 id="reliable-talent">Reliable Talent</h2>
    <p>
      By 11th level, you have refined your chosen skills until they approach perfection. Whenever you make an ability check that lets you add your
      proficiency bonus, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.
    </p>

    <h2 id="blindsense">Blindsense</h2>
    <p>
      Starting at 14th level, if you are able to hear, you are aware of the location of any hidden or invisible creature within 10 feet of you.
    </p>

    <h2 id="slippery-mind">Slippery Mind</h2>
    <p>By 15th level, you have acquired greater mental strength. You gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws.</p>

    <h2 id="elusive">Elusive</h2>
    <p>
      Beginning at 18th level, you are so evasive that attackers rarely gain the upper hand against you. No attack roll has advantage against you
      while you aren't incapacitated.
    </p>

    <h2 id="stroke-of-luck">Stroke of Luck</h2>
    <p>
      At 20th level, you have an uncanny knack for succeeding when you need to. If your attack misses a target within range, you can turn the miss
      into a hit. Alternatively, if you fail an ability check, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20.
    </p>
    <p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>

    <h1>Roguish Archetypes</h1>

    <h2 id="arcane-trickster">Arcane Trickster</h2>
    <p>
      Some rogues enhance their fine-honed skills of stealth and agility with magic, learning tricks of enchantment and illusion. These rogues
      include pickpockets and burglars, but also pranksters, mischief-makers, and a significant number of adventurers.

    </table>

    <h3>Spellcasting</h3>
    <p>When you reach 3rd level, you augment your martial prowess with the ability to cast spells.</p>

    <h4>Cantrips</h4>
    <p>
      You learn three cantrips: Mage Hand and two other cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn another wizard cantrip of
      your choice at 10th level.
    </p>

    <h4>Spell Slots</h4>
    <p>
      The Arcane Trickster Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your wizard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one
      of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, if you know the 1st-level spell Charm Person and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast Charm
      Person using either slot.
    </p>

    <h4>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</h4>
    <p>
      You know three 1st-level wizard spells of your choice, two of which you must choose from the enchantment and illusion spells on the wizard
      spell list.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Spells Known column of the Arcane Trickster Spellcasting table shows when you learn more wizard spells of 1st level or higher. Each of
      these spells must be an enchantment or illusion spell of your choice, and must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance,
      when you reach 7th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.
    </p>
    <p>The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can come from any school of magic.</p>
    <p>
      Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the wizard spells you know with another spell of your choice from the wizard
      spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, and it must be an enchantment or illusion spell, unless you're
      replacing the spell you gained at 3rd, 8th, 14th, or 20th level from any school of magic.
    </p>

    <h4>Spellcasting Ability</h4>
    <p>
      Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You
      use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the
      saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Spell save DC =</strong> 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>
    <p><strong>Spell attack modifier =</strong> your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>

    <h3>Mage Hand Legerdemain</h3>
    <p>
      Starting at 3rd level, when you cast Mage Hand, you can make the spectral hand invisible, and you can perform the following additional tasks
      with it:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>You can stow one object the hand is holding in a container worn or carried by another creature.</li>
      <li>You can retrieve an object in a container worn or carried by another creature.</li>
      <li>You can use thieves' tools to pick locks and disarm traps at range.</li>
      <li>
        You can perform one of these tasks without being noticed by a creature if you succeed on a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check contested by
        the creature's Wisdom (Perception) check.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>In addition, you can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to control the hand.</p>

    <h3>Magical Ambush</h3>
    <p>
      Starting at 9th level, if you are hidden from a creature when you cast a spell on it, the creature has disadvantage on any saving throw it
      makes against the spell this turn.
    </p>

    <h3>Versatile Trickster</h3>
    <p>
      At 13th level, you gain the ability to distract targets with your Mage Hand. As a bonus action on your turn, you can designate a creature
      within 5 feet of the spectral hand created by the spell. Doing so gives you advantage on attack rolls against that creature until the end of
      the turn.
    </p>

    <h3>Spell Thief</h3>
    <p>At 17th level, you gain the ability to magically steal the knowledge of how to cast a spell from another spellcaster.</p>
    <p>
      Immediately after a creature casts a spell that targets you or includes you in its area of effect, you can use your reaction to force the
      creature to make a saving throw with its spellcasting ability modifier. The DC equals your spell save DC. On a failed save, you negate the
      spell's effect against you, and you steal the knowledge of the spell if it is at least 1st level and of a level you can cast (it doesn't
      need to be a wizard spell). For the next 8 hours, you know the spell and can cast it using your spell slots. The creature can't cast that
      spell until the 8 hours have passed.
    </p>
    <p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>

    <h2 id="assassin">Assassin</h2>
    <p>
      You focus your training on the grim art of death. Those who adhere to this archetype are diverse: hired killers, spies, bounty hunters, and
      even specially anointed priests trained to exterminate the enemies of their deity. Stealth, poison, and disguise help you eliminate your
      foes with deadly efficiency.
    </p>

    <h3>Bonus Proficiencies</h3>
    <p>When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with the disguise kit and the poisoner's kit.</p>

    <h3>Assassinate</h3>
    <p>
      Starting at 3rd level, you are at your deadliest when you get the drop on your enemies. You have advantage on attack rolls against any
      creature that hasn't taken a turn in the combat yet. In addition, any hit you score against a creature that is surprised is a critical hit.
    </p>

    <h3>Infiltration Expertise</h3>
    <p>
      Starting at 9th level, you can unfailingly create false identities for yourself. You must spend seven days and 25 gp to establish the
      history, profession, and affiliations for an identity. You can't establish an identity that belongs to someone else. For example, you might
      acquire appropriate clothing, letters of introduction, and official-looking certification to establish yourself as a member of a trading
      house from a remote city so you can insinuate yourself into the company of other wealthy merchants.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereafter, if you adopt the new identity as a disguise, other creatures believe you to be that person until given an obvious reason not to.
    </p>

    <h3>Impostor</h3>
    <p>
      At 13th level, you gain the ability to unerringly mimic another person's speech, writing, and behavior. You must spend at least three hours
      studying these three components of the person's behavior, listening to speech, examining handwriting, and observing mannerisms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your ruse is indiscernible to the casual observer. If a wary creature suspects something is amiss, you have advantage on any Charisma
      (Deception) check you make to avoid detection.
    </p>

    <h3>Death Strike</h3>
    <p>
      Starting at 17th level, you become a master of instant death. When you attack and hit a creature that is surprised, it must make a
      Constitution saving throw (DC 8 + your Dexterity modifier + your proficiency bonus). On a failed save, double the damage of your attack
      against the creature.
    </p>

    <h2 id="inquisitive">Inquisitive</h2>
    <p>
      As an archetypal Inquisitive, you excel at rooting out secrets and unraveling mysteries. You rely on your sharp eye for detail, but also on
      your finely honed ability to read the words and deeds of other creatures to determine their true intent. You excel at defeating creatures
      that hide among and prey upon ordinary folk, and your mastery of lore and your sharp eye make you well equipped to expose and end hidden
      evils.
    </p>

    <h3>Ear for Deceit</h3>
    <p>
      When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you develop a keen ear for picking out lies. Whenever you make a Wisdom (Insight) check to
      determine whether a creature is lying, treat a roll of 7 or lower on the d20 as an 8.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Eye for Detail</h3>
    <p>
      Starting at 3rd level, you can use a bonus action to make a Wisdom (Perception) check to spot a hidden creature or object or to make an
      Intelligence (Investigation) check to uncover or decipher clues.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Insightful Fighting</h3>
    <p>
      At 3rd level, you gain the ability to decipher an opponent's tactics and develop a counter to them. As a bonus action, you make a Wisdom
      (Insight) check against a creature you can see that isn't incapacitated, contested by the target's Charisma (Deception) check. If you
      succeed, you can use your Sneak Attack against that target even if you don't have advantage on the attack roll, but not if you have
      disadvantage on it.
    </p>
    <p>This benefit lasts for 1 minute or until you successfully use this feature against a different target.</p>
    
    <h3>Steady Eye</h3>
    <p>
      At 9th level, you gain advantage on any Wisdom (Perception) or Intelligence (Investigation) check if you move no more than half your speed
      on the same turn.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Unerring Eye</h3>
    <p>
      At 13th level, your senses are almost impossible to foil. As an action, you sense the presence of illusions, shapechangers not in their
      original form, and other magic designed to deceive the senses within 30 feet of you, provided you aren't blinded or deafened. You sense that
      an effect is attempting to trick you, but you gain no insight into what is hidden or into its true nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses of it when you
      finish a long rest.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Eye for Weakness</h3>
    <p>
      At 17th level, you learn to exploit a creature's weaknesses by carefully studying its tactics and movement. While your Insightful Fighting
      feature applies to a creature, your Sneak Attack damage against that creature increases by 3d6.
    </p>

    <h2 id="mastermind">Mastermind</h2>
    <p>
      Your focus is on people and on the influence and secrets they have. Many spies, courtiers, and schemers follow this archetype, leading lives
      of intrigue. Words are your weapons as often as knives or poison, and secrets and favors are some of your favorite treasures.
    </p>

    <h3>Master of Intrigue</h3>
    <p>
      When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with the disguise kit, the forgery kit, and one gaming set of your choice.
      You also learn two languages of your choice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, you can unerringly mimic the speech patterns and accent of a creature that you hear speak for at least 1 minute, enabling you
      to pass yourself off as a native speaker of a particular land, provided that you know the language.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Master of Tactics</h3>
    <p>
      Starting at 3rd level, you can use the Help action as a bonus action. Additionally, when you use the Help action to aid an ally in attacking
      a creature, the target of that attack can be within 30 feet of you, rather than 5 feet of you, if the target can see or hear you.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Insightful Manipulator</h3>
    <p>
      Starting at 9th level, if you spend at least 1 minute observing or interacting with another creature outside combat, you can learn certain
      information about its capabilities compared to your own. The DM tells you if the creature is your equal, superior, or inferior in regard to
      two of the following characteristics of your choice:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Intelligence score</li>
      <li>Wisdom score</li>
      <li>Charisma score</li>
      <li>Class levels (if any)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>At the DM's option, you might also realize you know a piece of the creature's history or one of its personality traits, if it has any.</p>
    
    <h3>Misdirection</h3>
    <p>
      Beginning at 13th level, you can sometimes cause another creature to suffer an attack meant for you. When you are targeted by an attack
      while a creature within 5 feet of you is granting you cover against that attack, you can use your reaction to have the attack target that
      creature instead of you.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Soul of Deceit</h3>
    <p>
      Starting at 17th level, your thoughts can't be read by telepathy or other means, unless you allow it. You can present false thoughts by
      making a Charisma (Deception) check contested by the mind reader's Wisdom (Insight) check.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, no matter what you say, magic that would determine if you are telling the truth indicates you are being truthful if you so
      choose, and you can't be compelled to tell the truth by magic.
    </p>

    <h2 id="phantom">Phantom</h2>
    <p>
      Many rogues walk a fine line between life and death, risking their own lives and taking the lives of others. While adventuring on that line,
      some rogues discover a mystical connection to death itself. These rogues take knowledge from the dead and become immersed in negative
      energy, eventually becoming like ghosts. Thieves' guilds value them as highly effective information gatherers and spies.
    </p>
    <p>
      How did you discover this grim power? Did you sleep in a graveyard and awaken to your new abilities? Or did you cultivate them in a temple
      or thieves' guild dedicated to a deity of death?
    </p>

    <h3>Whispers of the Dead</h3>
    <p>
      When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, echoes of those who have died cling to you. Whenever you finish a short or long rest, you can
      gain one skill or tool proficiency of your choice, as a ghostly presence shares its knowledge with you. You lose this proficiency when you
      use this feature to choose a different proficiency that you lack.
    </p>

    <h3>Wails from the Grave</h3>
    <p>
      At 3rd level, as you nudge someone closer to the grave, you can channel the power of death to harm someone else as well. Immediately after
      you deal your Sneak Attack damage to a creature on your turn, you can target a second creature that you can see within 30 feet of the first
      creature. Roll half the number of Sneak Attack dice for your level (round up), and the second creature takes necrotic damage equal to the
      roll's total, as wails of the dead sound around them for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
    </p>

    <h3>Tokens of the Departed</h3>
    <p>
      At 9th level, when a life ends in your presence, you're able to snatch a token from the departing soul, a sliver of its life essence that
      takes physical form: as a reaction when a creature you can see dies within 30 feet of you, you can open your free hand and cause a Tiny
      trinket to appear there, a soul trinket. The DM determines the trinket's form or has you roll on the Trinkets table in the Player's Handbook
      to generate it.
    </p>
    <p>You can have a maximum number of soul trinkets equal to your proficiency bonus, and you can't create one while at your maximum.</p>
    <p>You can use soul trinkets in the following ways:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        While a soul trinket is on your person, you have advantage on death saving throws and Constitution saving throws, for your vitality is
        enhanced by the life essence within the object.
      </li>
      <li>
        When you deal Sneak Attack damage on your turn, you can destroy one of your soul trinkets that's on your person and then immediately use
        Wails from the Grave, without expending a use of that feature.
      </li>
      <li>
        As an action, you can destroy one of your soul trinkets, no matter where it's located. When you do so, you can ask the spirit associated
        with the trinket one question. The spirit appears to you and answers in a language it knew in life. It's under no obligation to be
        truthful, and it answers as concisely as possible, eager to be free. The spirit knows only what it knew in life, as determined by the DM.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Ghost Walk</h3>
    <p>
      At 13th level, you can phase partially into the realm of the dead, becoming like a ghost. As a bonus action, you assume a spectral form.
      While in this form, you have a flying speed of 10 feet, you can hover, and attack rolls have disadvantage against you. You can also move
      through creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain, but you take 1d10 force damage if you end your turn inside a creature or
      an object.
    </p>
    <p>
      You stay in this form for 10 minutes or until you end it as a bonus action. To use this feature again, you must finish a long rest or
      destroy one of your soul trinkets as part of the bonus action you use to activate Ghost Walk.
    </p>

    <h3>Death Knell</h3>
    <p>At 17th level, your association with death has become so close that you gain the following benefits:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>When you use your Wails from the Grave, you can now deal the necrotic damage to both the first and the second creature.</li>
      <li>
        At the end of a long rest, a soul trinket appears in your hand if you don't have any soul trinkets, as the spirits of the dead are drawn
        to you.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="scout">Scout</h2>

    <h2 id="soulknife">Soulknife</h2>
    <p>
      Most assassins strike with physical weapons, and many burglars and spies use thieves' tools to infiltrate secure locations. In contrast, a
      Soulknife strikes and infiltrates with the mind, cutting through barriers both physical and psychic. These rogues discover psionic power
      within themselves and channel it to do their roguish work. They find easy employment as members of thieves' guilds, though they are often
      mistrusted by rogues who are leery of anyone using strange mind powers to conduct their business. Most governments would also be happy to
      employ a Soulknife as a spy.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a Soulknife, your psionic abilities might have haunted you since you were a child, only revealing their full potential as you experienced
      the stress of adventure. Or you might have sought out a reclusive order of psychic adepts and spent years learning how to manifest your
      power.
    </p>

    <h3>Psionic Power</h3>
    <p>
      Starting at 3rd level, you harbor a wellspring of psionic energy within yourself. This energy is represented by your Psionic Energy dice,
      which are each a d6. You have a number of these dice equal to twice your proficiency bonus, and they fuel various psionic powers you have,
      which are detailed below.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of your powers expend the Psionic Energy die they use, as specified in a power's description, and you can't use a power if it requires
      you to use a die when your dice are all expended. You regain all your expended Psionic Energy dice when you finish a long rest. In addition,
      as a bonus action, you can regain one expended Psionic Energy die, but you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you reach certain levels in this class, the size of your Psionic Energy dice increases: at 5th level (d8), 11th level (d10), and 17th
      level (d12).
    </p>
    <p>The powers below use your Psionic Energy dice.</p>
    <p>
      <strong><em>Psi-Bolstered Knack.</em></strong> When your nonpsionic training fails you, your psionic power can help: if you fail an ability
      check using a skill or tool with which you have proficiency, you can roll one Psionic Energy die and add the number rolled to the check,
      potentially turning failure into success. You expend the die only if the roll succeeds.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><em>Psychic Whispers.</em></strong> You can establish telepathic communication between yourself and others — perfect for quiet
      infiltration. As an action, choose one or more creatures you can see, up to a number of creatures equal to your proficiency bonus, and then
      roll one Psionic Energy die. For a number of hours equal to the number rolled, the chosen creatures can speak telepathically with you, and
      you can speak telepathically with them. To send or receive a message (no action required), you and the other creature must be within 1 mile
      of each other. A creature can't use this telepathy if it can't speak any languages, and a creature can end the telepathic connection at any
      time (no action required). You and the creature don't need to speak a common language to understand each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first time you use this power after each long rest, you don't expend the Psionic Energy die. All other times you use the power, you
      expend the die.
    </p>

    <h3>Psychic Blades</h3>
    <p>
      Also at 3rd level, You can manifest your psionic power as shimmering blades of psychic energy. Whenever you take the Attack action, you can
      manifest a psychic blade from your free hand and make the attack with that blade. This magic blade is a simple melee weapon with the finesse
      and thrown properties. It has a normal range of 60 feet and no long range, and on a hit, it deals psychic damage equal to 1d6 plus the
      ability modifier you used for the attack roll. The blade vanishes immediately after it hits or misses its target, and it leaves no mark on
      its target if it deals damage.
    </p>
    <p>
      After you attack with the blade, you can make a melee or ranged weapon attack with a second psychic blade as a bonus action on the same
      turn, provided your other hand is free to create it. The damage die of this bonus attack is 1d4, instead of 1d6.
    </p>

    <h3>Soul Blades</h3>
    <p>
      Starting at 9th level, your Psychic Blades are now an expression of your psi-suffused soul, giving you these powers that use your Psionic
      Energy dice:
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><em>Homing Strikes.</em></strong> If you make an attack roll with your Psychic Blades and miss the target, you can roll one Psionic
      Energy die and add the number rolled to the attack roll. If this causes the attack to hit, you expend the Psionic Energy die.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><em>Psychic Teleportation.</em></strong> As a bonus action, you manifest one of your Psychic Blades, expend one Psionic Energy die
      and roll it, and throw the blade at an unoccupied space you can see, up to a number of feet away equal to 10 times the number rolled. You
      then teleport to that space, and the blade vanishes.
    </p>

    <h3>Psychic Veil</h3>
    <p>
      At 13th level, you can weave a veil of psychic static to mask yourself. As an action, you can magically become invisible, along with
      anything you are wearing or carrying, for 1 hour or until you dismiss this effect (no action required). This invisibility ends early
      immediately after you deal damage to a creature, or you force a creature to make a saving throw.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a Psionic Energy die to use this feature
      again.
    </p>

    <h3>Rend Mind</h3>
    <p>
      When you reach 17th level, you can sweep your Psychic Blade directly through a creature's mind. When you use your Psychic Blades to deal
      Sneak Attack damage to a creature, you can force that target to make a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your
      Dexterity modifier). If the save fails, the target is stunned for 1 minute. The stunned target can repeat the saving throw at the end of
      each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend three Psionic Energy dice to use it again.
    </p>

    <h2 id="swashbuckler">Swashbuckler</h2>
    <p>
      You focus your training on the art of the blade, relying on speed, elegance, and charm in equal parts. While some warriors are brutes clad
      in heavy armor, your method of fighting looks almost like a performance. Duelists and pirates typically belong to this archetype.
    </p>
    <p>A Swashbuckler excels in single combat, and can fight with two weapons while safely darting away from an opponent.</p>

    <h3>Fancy Footwork</h3>
    <p>
      When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn how to land a strike and then slip away without reprisal. During your turn, if you
      make a melee attack against a creature, that creature can't make opportunity attacks against you for the rest of your turn.
    </p>

    <h3>Rakish Audacity</h3>
    <p>
      Starting at 3rd level, your confidence propels you into battle. You can give yourself a bonus to your initiative rolls equal to your
      Charisma modifier.
    </p>
    <p>
      You also gain an additional way to use your Sneak Attack; you don't need advantage on the attack roll to use your Sneak Attack against a
      creature if you are within 5 feet of it, no other creatures are within 5 feet of you, and you don't have disadvantage on the attack roll.
      All the other rules for Sneak Attack still apply to you.
    </p>

    <h3>Panache</h3>
    <p>
      At 9th level, your charm becomes extraordinarily beguiling. As an action, you can make a Charisma (Persuasion) check contested by a
      creature's Wisdom (Insight) check. The creature must be able to hear you, and the two of you must share a language.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you succeed on the check and the creature is hostile to you, it has disadvantage on attack rolls against targets other than you and can't
      make opportunity attacks against targets other than you. This effect lasts for 1 minute, until one of your companions attacks the target or
      affects it with a spell, or until you and the target are more than 60 feet apart.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you succeed on the check and the creature isn't hostile to you, it is charmed by you for 1 minute. While charmed, it regards you as a
      friendly acquaintance. This effect ends immediately if you or your companions do anything harmful to it.
    </p>

    <h3>Elegant Maneuver</h3>
    <p>
      Starting at 13th level, you can use a bonus action on your turn to gain advantage on the next Dexterity (Acrobatics) or Strength (Athletics)
      check you make during the same turn.
    </p>

    <h3>Master Duelist</h3>
    <p>
      Beginning at 17th level, your mastery of the blade lets you turn failure into success in combat. If you miss with an attack roll, you can
      roll it again with advantage. Once you do so, you can't use this feature again until you finish a short or long rest.
    </p>

    <h2 id="thief">Thief</h2>
    <p>
      You hone your skills in the larcenous arts. Burglars, bandits, cutpurses, and other criminals typically follow this archetype, but so do
      rogues who prefer to think of themselves as professional treasure seekers, explorers, delvers, and investigators. In addition to improving
      your agility and stealth, you learn skills useful for delving into ancient ruins, reading unfamiliar languages, and using magic items you
      normally couldn't employ.
    </p>

    <h3>Fast Hands</h3>
    <p>
      Starting at 3rd level, you can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check, use your
      thieves' tools to disarm a trap or open a lock, or take the Use an Object action.
    </p>

    <h3>Second-Story Work</h3>
    <p>
      When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain the ability to climb faster than normal; climbing no longer costs you extra movement.
    </p>
    <p>In addition, when you make a running jump, the distance you cover increases by a number of feet equal to your Dexterity modifier.</p>

    <h3>Supreme Sneak</h3>
    <p>Starting at 9th level, you have advantage on a Dexterity (Stealth) check if you move no more than half your speed on the same turn.</p>

    <h3>Use Magic Device</h3>
    <p>
      By 13th level, you have learned enough about the workings of magic that you can improvise the use of items even when they are not intended
      for you. You ignore all class, race, and level requirements on the use of magic items.
    </p>

    <h3>Thief's Reflexes</h3>
    <p>
      When you reach 17th level, you have become adept at laying ambushes and quickly escaping danger. You can take two turns during the first
      round of any combat. You take your first turn at your normal initiative and your second turn at your initiative minus 10. You can't use
      this feature when you are surprised.
