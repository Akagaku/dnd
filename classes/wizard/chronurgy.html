    <h1>Wizard: Chronurgy</h1>
    <p>
      Focusing on the manipulation of time, those who follow the Chronurgy tradition learn to alter the pace of reality to their liking. Using
      the ramping of anticipatory dunamis energy, these mages can bend the flow of time as adroitly as a skilled musician plays an instrument,
      lending themselves and their allies an advantage in the blink of an eye.
    </p>

    <h2>Chronal Shift</h2>
    <p>
      At 2nd level, you can magically exert limited control over the flow of time around a creature. As a reaction, after you or a creature you
      can see within 30 feet of you makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, you can force the creature to reroll. You make
      this decision after you see whether the roll succeeds or fails. The target must use the result of the second roll.
    </p>
    <p>You can use this ability twice, and you regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>

    <h2>Temporal Awareness</h2>
    <p>Starting at 2nd level, you can add your Intelligence modifiers to your initiative rolls.</p>

    <h2>Momentary Stasis</h2>
    <p>
      When you reach 6th level, as an action, you can magically force a Large or smaller creature you can see within 60 feet of you to make a
      Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. If it fails, it is encased in a field of magical energy until the end of your next
      turn or until it takes any damage. While encased in this way, the creature is incapacitated and has a speed of 0.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you
      finish a long rest.
    </p>

    <h2>Arcane Abeyance</h2>
    <p>
      At 10th level, when you cast a spell using a spell slot of 4th level or lower, you can condense the spell's magic into a mote. The spell is
      frozen in time at the moment of casting and held within a gray bead for 1 hour. This bead is a Tiny object with AC 15 and 1 hit point, and
      it is immune to poison and psychic damage. When the duration ends, or if the bead is destroyed, it vanishes in aflash of light, and the
      spell is lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      A creature holding the bead can use its action to release the spell within, whereupon the bead disappears. The spell uses your spell attack
      bonus and save DC, and the spell treats the creature who released it as the caster for all other purposes.
    </p>
    <p>Once you create a bead with this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>

    <h2>Convergent Future</h2>
    <p>
      Starting at 14th level, you can peer through possible futures and magically pull one of them into events around you, ensuring a particular
      outcome. When you or a creature you can see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, you can use
      your reaction to ignore the die roll and decide whether the number rolled is the minimum needed to succeed or one less than that number
      (your choice).
    </p>
    <p>
      When you use this feature, you gain one level of exhaustion. Only by finishing a long rest can you remove a level of exhaustion gained in
      this way.
