    <h1>Wizard: Graviturgy</h1>
    <p>
      Understanding and mastering the forces that draw bodies of matter together or drive them apart, the students of the Graviturgy arcane
      tradition learn to further bend and manipulate the violent energy of gravity to their benefit, and the terrible detriment of their enemies.
    </p>

    <h2>Adjust Density</h2>
    <p>
      At 2nd level, as an action, you can magically alter the weight of one object or creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The object or
      creature must be Large or smaller. The target's weight is halved or doubled for up to 1 minute or until your concentration ends (as if you
      were concentrating on a spell).
    </p>
    <p>
      While the weight of a creature is halved by this effect, the creature's speed increases by 10 feet, it can jump twice as far as normal, and
      it has disadvantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the weight of a creature is doubled by this effect, the creature's speed is reduced by 10 feet, and it has advantage on Strength
      checks and Strength saving throws.
    </p>
    <p>Upon reaching 10th level in this class, you can target an object or a creature that is Huge or smaller.</p>

    <h2>Gravity Well</h2>
    <p>
      When you reach 6th level, whenever you cast a spell on a creature, you can move the target 5 feet to an unoccupied space of your choice if
      the target is willing to move, the spell hits it with an attack, or it fails a saving throw against the spell.
    </p>

    <h2>Violent Attraction</h2>
    <p>
      At 10th level, when another creature that you can see within 60 feet of you hits with a weapon attack, you can use your reaction to
      increase the attack's velocity, causing the attack's target to take an extra 1d10 damage of the weapon's type.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alternatively, if a creature within 60 feet of you takes damage from a fall, you can use your reaction to increase the fall's damage by
      2d10.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you
      finish a long rest.
    </p>

    <h2>Event Horizon</h2>
    <p>
      Starting at 14th level, as an action, you can magically emit a powerful field of gravitational energy that tugs at other creatures for up
      to 1 minute or until your concentration ends (as if you were concentrating on a spell). For the duration, whenever a creature hostile to
      you starts its turn within 30 feet of you, it must make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, it takes 2d10
      force damage, and its speed is reduced to 0 until the start of its next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage, and every
      foot it moves this turn costs 2 extra feet of movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest or until you expend a spell slot of 3rd level or higher on it.
