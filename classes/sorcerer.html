    <h1>Sorcerer</h1>
    <p>
      Sorcerers carry a magical birthright conferred upon them by an exotic bloodline, some otherworldly influence, or exposure to unknown cosmic
      forces. No one chooses sorcery; the power chooses the sorcerer.
    </p>
    <p><em>You must have a Charisma score of 13 or higher in order to multiclass in or out of this class.</em></p>

    <h1>Class Features</h1>
    <p>As a sorcerer, you gain the following class features.</p>

    <h3>Hit Points</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Hit Dice:</strong> 1d6<br>
      <strong>Hit Points at 1st Level:</strong> 6 + your Constitution modifier<br>
      <strong>Hit Points at Higher Levels:</strong>1d6 (or 4) + your Constitution modifier<br>
    </p>
    <h3>Proficiencies</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Armor:</strong> None<br>
      <strong>Weapons:</strong> Daggers, darts, slings, quarterstaffs, light crossbows<br>
      <strong>Tools:</strong> None<br>
      <strong>Saving Throws:</strong> Constitution, Charisma<br>
      <strong>Skills:</strong> Choose two from Arcana, Deception, Insight, Intimidation, Persuasion, and Religion
    </p>
    <h3>Equipment</h3>
    <p>You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>(a) a light crossbow and 20 bolts or (b) any simple weapon</li>
      <li>(a) a component pouch or (b) an arcane focus</li>
      <li>(a) a dungeoneer's pack or (b) an explorer's pack</li>
      <li>two daggers</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="spellcasting">Spellcasting</h2>
    <p>
      An event in your past, or in the life of a parent or ancestor, left an indelible mark on you, infusing you with arcane magic. This font of
      magic, whatever its origin, fuels your spells.
    </p>

    <h3>Cantrips</h3>
    <p>
      At 1st level, you know four cantrips of your choice from the sorcerer spell list. You learn additional sorcerer cantrips of your choice at
      higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Sorcerer table.
    </p>

    <h3>Spell Slots</h3>
    <p>
      The Sorcerer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your sorcerer spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these sorcerer
      spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, if you know the 1st-level spell burning hands and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast burning
      hands using either slot.
    </p>

    <h3>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</h3>
    <p>You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the sorcerer spell list.</p>
    <p>
      The Spells Known column of the Sorcerer table shows when you learn more sorcerer spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a
      level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the sorcerer spells you know and replace it with another spell from
      the sorcerer spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
    </p>

    <h3>Spellcasting Ability</h3>
    <p>
      Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your sorcerer spells, since the power of your magic relies on your ability to project your will
      into the world. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when
      setting the saving throw DC for a sorcerer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Spell save DC =</strong> 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>
    <p><strong>Spell attack modifier =</strong> your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>

    <h3>Spellcasting Focus</h3>
    <p>You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your sorcerer spells.</p>

    <h2 id="sorcerous-origin">Sorcerous Origin</h2>
    <p>
      Choose a sorcerous origin, which describes the source of your innate magical power. Choose
      <a href="sorcerer/aberrant-mind.html">Aberrant Mind</a>, <a href="sorcerer/clockwork-soul.html">Clockwork Soul</a>,
      <a href="sorcerer/draconic-bloodline.html">Draconic Bloodline</a>, <a href="sorcerer/divine-soul.html">Divine Soul</a>,
      <a href="sorcerer/shadow-magic.html">Shadow Magic</a>, <a href="sorcerer/storm-sorcery.html">Storm Sorcery</a>, or
      <a href="sorcerer/wild-magic.html">Wild Magic</a> Your choice grants you features when you choose it at 1st level and again at 6th, 14th,
      and 18th level.
    </p>

    <h2 id="font-of-magic">Font of Magic</h2>
    <p>
      At 2nd level, you tap into a deep wellspring of magic within yourself. This wellspring is represented by sorcery points, which allow you to
      create a variety of magical effects.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Sorcery Points.</strong> You have 2 sorcery points, and you gain more as you reach higher levels, as shown in the Sorcery Points
        column of the Sorcerer table. You can never have more sorcery points than shown on the table for your level. You regain all spent sorcery
        points when you finish a long rest.

    <h2 id="metamagic">Metamagic</h2>
    <p>
      At 3rd level, you gain the ability to twist your spells to suit your needs. You gain two of the following Metamagic options of your choice.
      You gain another one at 10th and 17th level.
    </p>
    <p>You can use only one Metamagic option on a spell when you cast it, unless otherwise noted.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Careful Spell.</strong> When you cast a spell that forces other creatures to make a saving throw, you can protect some of those
        creatures from the spell's full force. To do so, you spend 1 sorcery point and choose a number of those creatures up to your Charisma
        modifier (minimum of one creature). A chosen creature automatically succeeds on its saving throw against the spell.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Distant Spell.</strong> When you cast a spell that has a range of 5 feet or greater, you can spend 1 sorcery point to double the
        range of the spell. When you cast a spell that has a range of touch, you can spend 1 sorcery point to make the range of the spell 30 feet.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Empowered Spell.</strong> When you roll damage for a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point to reroll a number of the damage dice up to your
        Charisma modifier (minimum of one). You must use the new rolls. You can use Empowered Spell even if you have already used a different
        Metamagic option during the casting of the spell.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Extended Spell.</strong> When you cast a spell that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you can spend 1 sorcery point to double
        its duration, to a maximum duration of 24 hours.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Heightened Spell.</strong> When you cast a spell that forces a creature to make a saving throw to resist its effects, you can
        spend 3 sorcery points to give one target of the spell disadvantage on its first saving throw made against the spell.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Quickened Spell.</strong> When you cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 action, you can spend 2 sorcery points to change the
        casting time to 1 bonus action for this casting.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Seeking Spell.</strong> If you make an attack roll for a spell and miss, you can spend 2 sorcerer points to reroll the d20, and
        you must use the new roll. You can use Seeking Spell even if you have already used a different Metamagic option during the casting of the
        spell.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Ability Score Improvement</h2>
    <p>
      When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can
      increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.
    </p>

    <h2 id="sorcerous-restoration">Sorcerous Restoration</h2>
    <p>At 20th level, you regain 4 expended sorcery points whenever you finish a short rest.</p>
