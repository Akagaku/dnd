    <h1>Sorcerer</h1>
    <p>
      Sorcerers carry a magical birthright conferred upon them by an exotic bloodline, some otherworldly influence, or exposure to unknown cosmic
      forces. No one chooses sorcery; the power chooses the sorcerer.
    </p>
    <p><em>You must have a Charisma score of 13 or higher in order to multiclass in or out of this class.</em></p>

      <li>(a) a light crossbow and 20 bolts or (b) any simple weapon</li>
      <li>(a) a component pouch or (b) an arcane focus</li>

    <h2 id="spellcasting">Spellcasting</h2>
    <p>
      An event in your past, or in the life of a parent or ancestor, left an indelible mark on you, infusing you with arcane magic. This font of
      magic, whatever its origin, fuels your spells.
    </p>

    <h3>Cantrips</h3>
    <p>
      At 1st level, you know four cantrips of your choice from the sorcerer spell list. You learn additional sorcerer cantrips of your choice at
      higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Sorcerer table.
    </p>

    <h3>Spell Slots</h3>
    <p>
      The Sorcerer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your sorcerer spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these sorcerer
      spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, if you know the 1st-level spell burning hands and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast burning
      hands using either slot.
    </p>

    <h3>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</h3>
    <p>You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the sorcerer spell list.</p>
    <p>
      The Spells Known column of the Sorcerer table shows when you learn more sorcerer spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a
      level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the sorcerer spells you know and replace it with another spell from
      the sorcerer spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
    </p>

    <h3>Spellcasting Ability</h3>
    <p>
      Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your sorcerer spells, since the power of your magic relies on your ability to project your will
      into the world. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when
      setting the saving throw DC for a sorcerer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Spell save DC =</strong> 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>
    <p><strong>Spell attack modifier =</strong> your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>

    <h3>Spellcasting Focus</h3>
    <p>You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your sorcerer spells.</p>

    <h2 id="sorcerous-origin">Sorcerous Origin</h2>
    <p>
      Choose a sorcerous origin, which describes the source of your innate magical power. Choose <a href="#aberrant-mind">Aberrant Mind</a>,

      grants you features when you choose it at 1st level and again at 6th, 14th, and 18th level.
    </p>

    <h2 id="font-of-magic">Font of Magic</h2>
    <p>
      At 2nd level, you tap into a deep wellspring of magic within yourself. This wellspring is represented by sorcery points, which allow you to
      create a variety of magical effects.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Sorcery Points.</strong> You have 2 sorcery points, and you gain more as you reach higher levels, as shown in the Sorcery Points
        column of the Sorcerer table. You can never have more sorcery points than shown on the table for your level. You regain all spent sorcery
        points when you finish a long rest.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Flexible Casting.</strong> You can use your sorcery points to gain additional spell slots, or sacrifice spell slots to gain
        additional sorcery points. You learn other ways to use your sorcery points as you reach higher levels.
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Creating Spell Slots.</strong> You can transform unexpended sorcery points into one spell slot as a bonus action on your turn.
            The Creating Spell Slots table shows the cost of creating a spell slot of a given level. You can create spell slots no higher in level
            than 5th. Any spell slot you create with this feature vanishes when you finish a long rest.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Converting a Spell Slot to Sorcery Points.</strong> As a bonus action on your turn, you can expend one spell slot and gain a
            number of sorcery points equal to the slot's level.
          </li>
        </ul>

    <h2 id="metamagic">Metamagic</h2>
    <p>
      At 3rd level, you gain the ability to twist your spells to suit your needs. You gain two of the following Metamagic options of your choice.
      You gain another one at 10th and 17th level.
    </p>
    <p>You can use only one Metamagic option on a spell when you cast it, unless otherwise noted.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Careful Spell.</strong> When you cast a spell that forces other creatures to make a saving throw, you can protect some of those
        creatures from the spell's full force. To do so, you spend 1 sorcery point and choose a number of those creatures up to your Charisma
        modifier (minimum of one creature). A chosen creature automatically succeeds on its saving throw against the spell.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Distant Spell.</strong> When you cast a spell that has a range of 5 feet or greater, you can spend 1 sorcery point to double the
        range of the spell. When you cast a spell that has a range of touch, you can spend 1 sorcery point to make the range of the spell 30 feet.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Empowered Spell.</strong> When you roll damage for a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point to reroll a number of the damage dice up to your
        Charisma modifier (minimum of one). You must use the new rolls. You can use Empowered Spell even if you have already used a different
        Metamagic option during the casting of the spell.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Extended Spell.</strong> When you cast a spell that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you can spend 1 sorcery point to double
        its duration, to a maximum duration of 24 hours.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Heightened Spell.</strong> When you cast a spell that forces a creature to make a saving throw to resist its effects, you can
        spend 3 sorcery points to give one target of the spell disadvantage on its first saving throw made against the spell.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Quickened Spell.</strong> When you cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 action, you can spend 2 sorcery points to change the
        casting time to 1 bonus action for this casting.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Seeking Spell.</strong> If you make an attack roll for a spell and miss, you can spend 2 sorcerer points to reroll the d20, and
        you must use the new roll. You can use Seeking Spell even if you have already used a different Metamagic option during the casting of the
        spell.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Ability Score Improvement</h2>
    <p>
      When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can
      increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.
    </p>

    <h2 id="sorcerous-restoration">Sorcerous Restoration</h2>
    <p>At 20th level, you regain 4 expended sorcery points whenever you finish a short rest.</p>

    <h1>Sorcerous Origins</h1>

    <h2 id="aberrant-mind">Aberrant Mind</h2>
    <p>
      An alien influence has wrapped its tendrils around your mind, giving you psionic power. You can now touch other minds with that power and
      alter the world around you by using it to control the magical energy of the multiverse. Will this power shine from you as a hopeful beacon
      to others? Or will you be a source of terror to those who feel the stab of your mind and witness the strange manifestations of your might?
    </p>
    <p>
      As an Aberrant Mind sorcerer, you decide how you acquired your powers. Were you born with them? Or did an event later in life leave you
      shining with psionic awareness? Consult the Aberrant Origins table for a possible origin of your power.

    <h3>Psionic Spells</h3>
    <p>
      Starting at 1st level, you learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Psionic Spells table. Each
      of these spells counts as a sorcerer spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of sorcerer spells you know.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whenever you gain a sorcerer level, you can replace one spell you gained from this feature with another spell of the same level. The new

    <h3>Telepathic Speech</h3>
    <p>
      Starting at 1st level, you can form a telepathic connection between your mind and the mind of another. As a bonus action, choose one
      creature you can see within 30 feet of you. You and the chosen creature can speak telepathically with each other while the two of you are
      within a number of miles of each other equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1 mile). To understand each other, you each must speak
      mentally in a language the other knows.
    </p>
    <p>
      The telepathic connection lasts for a number of minutes equal to your sorcerer level. It ends early if you are incapacitated or die or if
      you use this ability to form a connection with a different creature.
    </p>

    <h3>Psionic Sorcery</h3>
    <p>
      Beginning at 6th level, when you cast any spell of 1st level or higher from your Psionic Spells feature, you can cast it by expending a
      spell slot as normal or by spending a number of sorcery points equal to the spell's level. If you cast the spell using sorcery points, it
      requires no verbal or somatic components, and it requires no material components, unless they are consumed by the spell.
    </p>

    <h3>Psychic Defenses</h3>
    <p>At 6th level, you gain resistance to psychic damage, and you have advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened.</p>

    <h3>Revelation in Flesh</h3>
    <p>
      Beginning at 14th level, you can unleash the aberrant truth hidden within yourself. As a bonus action, you can spend 1 or more sorcery
      points to magically transform your body for 10 minutes. For each sorcery point you spend, you can gain one of the following benefits of your
      choice, the effects of which last until the transformation ends:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        You can see any invisible creature within 60 feet of you, provided it isn't behind total cover. Your eyes also turn black or become
        writhing sensory tendrils.
      </li>
      <li>
        You gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed and can hover. As you fly, your skin glistens with mucus or shines with an
        otherworldly light.
      </li>
      <li>
        You gain a swimming speed equal to twice your walking speed, and you can breathe underwater. Moreover, gills grow from your neck or fan
        out from behind your ears, your fingers become webbed, or you grow writhing cilia that extend through your clothing.
      </li>
      <li>
        Your body, along with any equipment you are wearing or carrying, becomes slimy and pliable. You can move through any space as narrow as 1
        inch without squeezing, and you can spend 5 feet of movement to escape from nonmagical restraints or being grappled.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Warping Implosion</h3>
    <p>
      At 18th level, you can unleash your aberrant power as a space-warping anomaly. As an action, you can teleport to an unoccupied space you can
      see within 120 feet of you. Immediately after you disappear, each creature within 30 feet of the space you left must make a Strength saving
      throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 3d10 force damage and is pulled straight toward the space you left, ending in an unoccupied space
      as close to your former space as possible. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't pulled.
    </p>
    <p>Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest, unless you spend 5 sorcery points to use it again.</p>

    <h2 id="clockwork-soul">Clockwork Soul</h2>
    <p>
      The cosmic force of order has suffused you with magic. That power arises from Mechanus or a realm like it-a plane of existence shaped
      entirely by clockwork efficiency. You, or someone from your lineage, might have become entangled in the machinations of the modrons, the
      orderly beings who inhabit Mechanus. Perhaps your ancestor even took part in the Great Modron March. Whatever its origin within you, the power
      of order can seem strange to others, but for you, it is part of a vast and glorious system.
    </p>

    <h3>Clockwork Magic</h3>
    <p>
      You learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Clockwork Spells table. Each spell counts as a
      sorcerer spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of sorcerer spells you know. These spells can't be replaced when you gain a
      level in this class.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whenever you gain a sorcerer level, you can replace one spell you gained from this feature with another spell of the same level. The new
      spell must be an abjuration or a transmutation spell from the sorcerer, warlock, or wizard spell list.

    <h3>Restore Balance</h3>
    <p>
      Starting at 1st level, your connection to the plane of absolute order allows you to equalize chaotic moments. When a creature you can see
      within 60 feet of you is about to roll a d20 with advantage or disadvantage, you can use your reaction to prevent the roll from being
      affected by advantage and disadvantage.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
    </p>

    <h3>Bastion of Law</h3>
    <p>
      Starting at 6th level, you can tap into the grand equation of existence to imbue a creature with a shimmering shield of order. As an action,
      you can expend 1 to 5 sorcery points to create a magical ward around yourself or another creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The
      ward lasts until you finish a long rest or until you use this feature again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ward is represented by a number of d8s equal to the number of sorcery points spent to create it. When the warded creature takes damage,
      it can expend a number of those dice, roll them, and reduce the damage taken by the total rolled on those dice.
    </p>

    <h3>Trance of Order</h3>
    <p>
      Starting at 14th level, you gain the ability to align your consciousness to the endless calculations of Mechanus. As a bonus action, you can
      enter this state for 1 minute. For the duration, attack rolls against you can't benefit from advantage, and whenever you make an attack
      roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, you can treat a roll of 9 or lower on the d20 as a 10.
    </p>
    <p>Once you use this bonus action, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest, unless you spend 5 sorcery points to use it again.</p>

    <h3>Clockwork Cavalcade</h3>
    <p>
      At 18th level, you summon spirits of order to expunge disorder around you. As an action, you summon the spirits in a 30-foot cube
      originating from you. The spirits look like modrons or other constructs of your choice. The spirits are intangible and invulnerable, and
      they create the following effects within the cube before vanishing:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The spirits restore up to 100 hit points, divided as you choose among any number of creatures of your choice in the cube.</li>
      <li>Any damaged objects entirely in the cube are repaired instantly.</li>
      <li>Every spell of 6th level or lower ends on creatures and objects of your choice in the cube.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Once you use this action, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest, unless you spend 7 sorcery points to use it again.</p>

    <h2 id="draconic-bloodline">Draconic Bloodline</h2>
    <p>
      Your innate magic comes from draconic magic that was mingled with your blood or that of your ancestors. Most often, sorcerers with this
      origin trace their descent back to a mighty sorcerer of ancient times who made a bargain with a dragon or who might even have claimed a
      dragon parent. Some of these bloodlines are well established in the world, but most are obscure. Any given sorcerer could be the first of a
      new bloodline, as a result of a pact or some other exceptional circumstance.
    </p>

    <h3>Dragon Ancestor</h3>
    <p>
      At 1st level, you choose one type of dragon as your ancestor. The damage type associated with each dragon is used by features you gain later.

    <p>
      You can speak, read, and write Draconic. Additionally, whenever you make a Charisma check when interacting with dragons, your proficiency
      bonus is doubled if it applies to the check.
    </p>

    <h3>Draconic Resilience</h3>
    <p>
      As magic flows through your body, it causes physical traits of your dragon ancestors to emerge. At 1st level, your hit point maximum
      increases by 1 and increases by 1 again whenever you gain a level in this class.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, parts of your skin are covered by a thin sheen of dragon-like scales. When you aren't wearing armor, your AC equals 13 + your
      Dexterity modifier.
    </p>

    <h3>Elemental Affinity</h3>
    <p>
      Starting at 6th level, when you cast a spell that deals damage of the type associated with your draconic ancestry, add your Charisma
      modifier to one damage roll of that spell. At the same time, you can spend 1 sorcery point to gain resistance to that damage type for 1
      hour.
    </p>

    <h3>Dragon Wings</h3>
    <p>
      At 14th level, you gain the ability to sprout a pair of dragon wings from your back, gaining a flying speed equal to your current speed.
      You can create these wings as a bonus action on your turn. They last until you dismiss them as a bonus action on your turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can't manifest your wings while wearing armor unless the armor is made to accommodate them, and clothing not made to accommodate your
      wings might be destroyed when you manifest them.
    </p>

    <h3>Draconic Presence</h3>
    <p>
      Beginning at 18th level, you can channel the dread presence of your dragon ancestor, causing those around you to become awestruck or
      frightened. As an action, you can spend 5 sorcery points to draw on this power and exude an aura of awe or fear (your choice) to a distance
      of 60 feet. For 1 minute or until you lose your concentration (as if you were casting a concentration spell), each hostile creature that
      starts its turn in this aura must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed (if you chose awe) or frightened (if you chose fear) until
      the aura ends. A creature that succeeds on this saving throw is immune to your aura for 24 hours.
    </p>

    <h2 id="divine-soul">Divine Soul</h2>
    <p>
      Sometimes the spark of magic that fuels a sorcerer comes from a divine source that glimmers within the soul. Having such a blessed soul is
      a sign that your innate magic might come from a distant but powerful familial connection to a divine being. Perhaps your ancestor was an
      angel, transformed into a mortal and sent to fight in a god's name. Or your birth might align with an ancient prophecy, marking you as a
      servant of the gods or a chosen vessel of divine magic.
    </p>
    <p>
      A Divine Soul, with natural magnetism, is seen as a threat by some religious hierarchies. As an outsider who commands celestial power,
      these sorcerers can undermine the existing order by claiming a direct tie to the divine.
    </p>

    <h3>Divine Magic</h3>
    <p>
      Your link to the divine allows you to learn spells normally associated with the cleric class. When your Spellcasting feature lets you learn
      a sorcerer cantrip or a sorcerer spell of 1st level or higher, you can choose the new spell from the cleric spell list or the sorcerer
      spell list. You must otherwise obey all the restrictions for selecting the spell, and it becomes a sorcerer spell for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, choose an affinity for the source of your divine power: good, evil, law, chaos, or neutrality. You learn an additional spell
      based on that affinity, as shown below. It is a sorcerer spell for you, but it doesn't count against your number of sorcerer spells known.
      If you later replace this spell, you must replace it with a spell from the cleric spell list.
    </p>

    <h3>Favored by the Gods</h3>
    <p>
      Starting at 1st level, divine power guards your destiny. If you fail a saving throw or miss with an attack roll, you can roll 2d4 and add
      it to the total, possibly changing the outcome.
    </p>
    <p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
    
    <h3>Empowered Healing</h3>
    <p>
      Starting at 6th level, the divine energy coursing through you can empower healing spells. Whenever you or an ally within 5 feet of you
      rolls dice to determine the number of hit points a spell restores, you can spend 1 sorcery point to reroll any number of those dice once,
      provided you aren't incapacitated. You can use this feature only once per turn.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Angelic Form</h3>
    <p>
      Starting at 14th level, you can use a bonus action to manifest a pair of spectral wings from your back. While the wings are present, you
      have a flying speed of 30 feet. The wings last until you're incapacitated, you die, or you dismiss them as a bonus action.
    </p>
    <p>
      The affinity you chose for your Divine Magic feature determines the appearance of the spectral wings: eagle wings for good or law, bat
      wings for evil or chaos, and dragonfly wings for neutrality.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Unearthly Recovery</h3>
    <p>
      At 18th level, you gain the ability to overcome grievous injuries. As a bonus action when you have fewer than half of your hit points
      remaining, you can regain a number of hit points equal to half your hit point maximum.
    </p>
    <p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>

    <h2 id="shadow-magic">Shadow Magic</h2>
    <p>
      You are a creature of shadow, for your innate magic comes from the Shadowfell itself. You might trace your lineage to an entity from that
      place, or perhaps you were exposed to its fell energy and transformed by it. The power of shadow magic casts a strange pall over your
      physical presence. The spark of life that sustains you is muffled, as if it struggles to remain viable against the dark energy that imbues
      your soul.
    </p>
    <h3>Shadow Sorcerer Quirks</h3>
    <p>At your option, you can pick from or roll on the Shadow Sorcerer Quirks table to create a quirk for your character.</p>
    <table class="table table-striped">

    <h3>Eyes of the Dark</h3>
    <p>From 1st level, you have darkvision with a range of 120 feet.</p>
    <p>
      When you reach 3rd level in this class, you learn the darkness spell, which doesn't count against your number of sorcerer spells known. In
      addition, you can cast it by spending 2 sorcery points or by expending a spell slot. If you cast it with sorcery points, you can see
      through the darkness created by the spell.
    </p>

    <h3>Strength of the Grave</h3>
    <p>
      Starting at 1st level, your existence in a twilight state between life and death makes you difficult to defeat. When damage reduces you to
      0 hit points, you can make a Charisma saving throw (DC 5 + the damage taken). On a success, you instead drop to 1 hit point. You can't use
      this feature if you are reduced to 0 hit points by radiant damage or by a critical hit.
    </p>
    <p>After the saving throw succeeds, you can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest.</p>

    <h3>Hound of Ill Omen</h3>
    <p>
      At 6th level, you gain the ability to call forth a howling creature of darkness to harass your foes. As a bonus action, you can spend 3
      sorcery points to summon a hound of ill omen to target one creature you can see within 120 feet of you. The hound uses the dire wolf's
      statistics, with the following changes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The hound is size Medium, not Large, and it counts as a monstrosity, not a beast.</li>
      <li>It appears with a number of temporary hit points equal to half your sorcerer level.</li>
      <li>
        It can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. The hound takes 5 force damage if it ends its turn
        inside an object.
      </li>
      <li>
        At the start of its turn, the hound automatically knows its target's location. If the target was hidden, it is no longer hidden from the
        hound.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The hound appears in an unoccupied space of your choice within 30 feet of the target. Roll initiative for the hound. On its turn, it can
      move only toward its target by the most direct route, and it can use its action only to attack its target. The hound can make opportunity
      attacks, but only against its target. Additionally, while the hound is within 5 feet of the target, the target has disadvantage on saving
      throws against any spell you cast. The hound disappears if it is reduced to 0 hit points, if its target is reduced to 0 hit points, or
      after 5 minutes.
    </p>

    <h3>Shadow Walk</h3>
    <p>
      At 14th level, you gain the ability to step from one shadow into another. When you are in dim light or darkness, as a bonus action, you can
      teleport up to 120 feet to an unoccupied space you can see that is also in dim light or darkness.
    </p>

    <h3>Umbral Form</h3>
    <p>
      Starting at 18th level, you can spend 6 sorcery points as a bonus action to transform yourself into a shadowy form. In this form, you have
      resistance to all damage except force and radiant damage, and you can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult
      terrain. You take 5 force damage if you end your turn inside an object.
    </p>
    <p>You remain in this form for 1 minute. It ends early if you are incapacitated, if you die, or if you dismiss it as a bonus action.</p>

    <h2 id="storm-sorcery">Storm Sorcery</h2>
    <p>
      Your innate magic comes from the power of elemental air. Many with this power can trace their magic back to a near-death experience on the
      Wound, but perhaps you were born during a howling gale so powerful that folk still tell stories of it, or your lineage might include the
      influence of potent air creatures such as vaati or djinn. Whatever the case, the magic of the storm permeates your being.
    </p>
    <p>
      Storm sorcerers are invaluable members of a ship's crew. Their magic allows them to exert control over wind and weather in their immediate
      area. Their abilities also prove useful in repelling attacks by sahuagin, pirates, and other waterborne threats.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Wind Speaker</h3>
    <p>
      The arcane magic you command is infused with elemental air. You can speak, read, and write Primordial. Knowing this language allows you to
      understand and be understood by those who speak its dialects: Aquan, Auran, Ignan, and Terran.
    </p>

    <h3>Tempestuous Magic</h3>
    <p>
      Starting at 1st level, you can use a bonus action on your turn to cause whirling gusts of elemental air to briefly surround you,
      immediately before or after you cast a spell of 1st level or higher. Doing so allows you to fly up to 10 feet without provoking opportunity
      attacks.
    </p>

    <h3>Heart of the Storm</h3>
    <p>
      At 6th level, you gain resistance to lightning and thunder damage. In addition, whenever you start casting a spell of 1st level or higher
      that deals lightning or thunder damage, stormy magic erupts from you. This eruption causes creatures of your choice that you can see within
      10 feet of you to take lightning or thunder damage (choose each time this ability activates) equal to half your sorcerer level.
    </p>

    <h3>Storm Guide</h3>
    <p>At 6th level, you gain the ability to subtly control the weather around you.</p>
    <p>
      If it is raining, you can use an action to cause the rain to stop falling in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on you. You can end this
      effect as a bonus action.
    </p>
    <p>
      If it is windy, you can use a bonus action each round to choose the direction that the wind blows in a 100-foot-radius sphere centered on
      you. The wind blows in that direction until the end of your next turn. This feature doesn't alter the speed of the wind.
    </p>

    <h3>Storm's Fury</h3>
    <p>
      Starting at 14th level, when you are hit by a melee attack, you can use your reaction to deal lightning damage to the attacker. The damage
      equals your sorcerer level. The attacker must also make a Strength saving throw against your sorcerer spell save DC. On a failed save, the
      attacker is pushed in a straight line up to 20 feet away from you.
    </p>

    <h3>Wind Soul</h3>
    <p>At 18th level, you gain immunity to lightning and thunder damage.</p>
    <p>
      You also gain a magical flying speed of 60 feet. As an action, you can reduce your flying speed to 30 feet for 1 hour and choose a number
      of creatures within 30 feet of you equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier. The chosen creatures gain a magical flying speed of 30 feet for 1
      hour. Once you reduce your flying speed in this way, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.
    </p>

    <h2 id="wild-magic">Wild Magic</h2>
    <p>
      Your innate magic comes from the wild forces of chaos that underlie the order of creation. You might have endured exposure to some form of
      raw magic, perhaps through a planar portal leading to Limbo, the Elemental Planes, or the mysterious Far Realm. Perhaps you were blessed by
      a powerful fey creature or marked by a demon. Or your magic could be a fluke of your birth, with no apparent cause or reason. However it
      came to be, this chaotic magic churns within you, waiting for any outlet.
    </p>

    <h3>Wild Magic Surge</h3>
    <p>
      Starting when you choose this origin at 1st level, your spellcasting can unleash surges of untamed magic. Once per turn, the DM can have
      you roll a d20 immediately after you cast a sorcerer spell of 1st level or higher. If you roll a 1, roll on the Wild Magic Surge table to
      create a magical effect. If that effect is a spell, it is too wild to be affected by your Metamagic, and if it normally requires
      concentration, it doesn't require concentration in this case; the spell lasts for its full duration.
    </p>

    <h3>Tides of Chaos</h3>
    <p>
      Starting at 1st level, you can manipulate the forces of chance and chaos to gain advantage on one attack roll, ability check, or saving
      throw. Once you do so, you must finish a long rest before you can use this feature again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any time before you regain the use of this feature, the DM can have you roll on the Wild Magic Surge table immediately after you cast a
      sorcerer spell of 1st level or higher. You then regain the use of this feature.
    </p>

    <h3>Bend Luck</h3>
    <p>
      Starting at 6th level, you have the ability to twist fate using your wild magic. When another creature you can see makes an attack roll, an
      ability check, or a saving throw, you can use your reaction and spend 2 sorcery points to roll 1d4 and apply the number rolled as a bonus
      or penalty (your choice) to the creature's roll. You can do so after the creature rolls but before any effects of the roll occur.
    </p>

    <h3>Controlled Chaos</h3>
    <p>
      At 14th level, you gain a modicum of control over the surges of your wild magic. Whenever you roll on the Wild Magic Surge table, you can
      roll twice and use either number.
    </p>

    <h3>Spell Bombardment</h3>
    <p>
      Beginning at 18th level, the harmful energy of your spells intensifies. When you roll damage for a spell and roll the highest number
      possible on any of the dice, choose one of those dice, roll it again and add that roll to the damage. You can use the feature only once per
      turn.
