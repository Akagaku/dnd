    <h1>Blood Hunter: Order of the Ghostslayer</h1>
    <p>
      The Order of the Ghostslayer is the oldest of the blood hunter orders, its members having originally rediscovered the secrets of hemocraft
      and refined them for combat against the scourge of undeath. Ghostslayers seek out and study the moment of death, obsessing over the mystery
      of the transition from life, and the unholy power that can cause the dead to rise once more. These zealous blood hunters make it their
      life's work to destroy the scourge of undeath wherever it is found, tuning their abilities to engage undead creatures and those who
      manipulate the necromancy that creates them.
    </p>

    <h2>Rite of the Dawn</h2>
    <p>
      When you join this order at 3rd level, you learn the Rite of the Dawn as part of your Crimson Rite feature. When you activate the Rite of
      the Dawn, the extra damage dealt by your rite is radiant damage. Additionally, while that rite is active on your weapon, you gain the
      following benefits:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your weapon sheds bright light out to a radius of 20 feet.</li>
      <li>You have resistance to necrotic damage.</li>
      <li>
        When you hit an undead creature with a weapon for which the Rite of the Dawn is active, you roll an additional hemocraft die when
        determining the extra damage from the rite.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Curse Specialist</h2>
    <p>
      Starting at 3rd level, you learn to master blood curses. You gain an additional use of your Blood Maledict feature. In addition, your blood
      curses can target any creature, whether it has blood or not.
    </p>

    <h2>Aether Walk</h2>
    <p>
      Upon reaching 7th level, at the start of your turn, you can magically step into the veil between the planes as long as you aren't
      incapacitated. You can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain, as well as see and affect creatures and
      objects on the Ethereal Plane. You take 1d10 force damage if you end your turn inside an object.
    </p>
    <p>
      This feature lasts for a number of rounds equal to your Hemocraft modifier (minimum of 1 round). If you are inside an object when it ends,
      you are immediately shunted to the nearest unoccupied space and you take force damage equal to twice the number of feet you moved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again. You can use Aether Walk twice between rests
      starting at 15th level.
    </p>

    <h2>Brand of Sundering</h2>
    <p>
      Starting at 11th level, your Brand of Castigation exposes a fragment of your foe's essence, leaving them vulnerable to your Crimson Rite
      feature. Whenever you hit a creature with a weapon for which you have an active crimson rite, you roll an additional hemocraft die when
      determining the extra damage from the rite. Additionally, if a branded creature has the Incorporeal Movement trait or a similar feature, it
      can't move through creatures or objects while branded.
    </p>

    <h2>Blood Curse of the Exorcist</h2>
    <p>
      At 15th level, you hone your hemocraft to tear corruption from the minds and bodies of your allies â€” and to punish those responsible for
      it. You gain the Blood Curse of the Exorcist for your Blood Maledict feature. This doesn't count against your number of blood curses known.
    </p>

    <h2>Rite Revival</h2>
    <p>
      Upon reaching 18th level, you learn to protect your fading life by reabsorbing the energy you feed to your weapons. If you have one or more
      crimson rites active and you are reduced to 0 hit points but don't die outright, you can choose to have all your active crimson rites end
      and drop to 1 hit point instead.
