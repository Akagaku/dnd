    <h1>Blood Hunter: Order of the Lycan</h1>
    <p>
      The curse of lycanthropy is feared by nearly all peoples and cultures, passed through blood and seeding a host with the savage
      strength and hunger for violence of a wicked beast. The Order of the Lycan is a proud group of blood hunters who undergo “the Taming”—the
      ceremonial imbibing of lycan blood. These hunters then use the magic of their blood to harness the power of the monster without losing
      themselves to it.
    </p>

    <h2>Heightened Senses</h2>
    <p>
      When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain the improved senses of a natural predator. You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception)
      checks that rely on hearing or smell.
    </p>

    <h2>Hybrid Transformation</h2>
    <p>
      Also at 3rd level, you learn to control the lycanthropic curse that courses through your veins. As a bonus action, you transform into a
      special hybrid form for up to 1 hour. You can speak, use equipment, and wear armor while in this form, and can revert to your normal form
      as a bonus action. You automatically revert to your normal form if you fall unconscious or die.
    </p>
    <p>
      This feature replaces the rules for lycanthropy in the Monster Manual. Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest
      before you can use it again. While you are transformed, you gain the following features:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Feral Might.</strong> You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws, and you have a +1 bonus to melee damage
        rolls. This bonus increases to +2 at 11th level and to +3 at 18th level.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Resilient Hide.</strong> You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks not made with
        silvered weapons. Additionally, while you are not wearing heavy armor, you have a +1 bonus to AC.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Predatory Strikes.</strong> You can apply your Crimson Rite feature to your unarmed strikes, which you treat as one weapon. You
        can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes, which deal 1d6 bludgeoning or slashing
        damage (your choice). This damage increases to 1d8 at 11th level.
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Additionally, when you use the Attack action to make an unarmed strike, you can make one additional unarmed strike as a bonus action.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Bloodlust.</strong> If you start your turn with fewer hit points than half your hit point maximum, you must succeed on a DC 8
        Wisdom saving throw or move directly toward the nearest creature and use the Attack action against that creature. If you're concentrating
        on a spell or are under an effect that prevents you from concentrating (such as the barbarian's Rage feature), you automatically fail
        this saving throw.
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          If you have your Extra Attack feature, you can choose whether to use it for this frenzied attack. If more than one creature is equally
          near to you, roll randomly to determine your target. Once your attack is resolved, you regain control of yourself.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </ul>

    <h2>Stalker's Prowess</h2>
    <p>
      At 7th level, your speed increases by 10 feet, and you add 10 feet to your long jump distance and 3 feet to your high jump distance. Your
      hybrid form also gains the following additional benefit.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Improved Predatory Strikes.</strong> You have a +1 bonus to attack rolls made with your unarmed strike. This bonus increases to
        +2 at 11th level and to +3 at 18th level. Additionally, when you have an active crimson rite on your unarmed strike while in your hybrid
        form, your unarmed strikes are considered magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Advanced Transformation</h2>
    <p>
      At 11th level, you learn to unleash and control more of the beast within. You can use your Hybrid Transformation feature twice, regaining
      all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest. Your hybrid form also gains the following additional benefit.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Lycan Regeneration.</strong> At the start of each of your turns when you have at least 1 hit point but fewer hit points than half
        your hit point maximum, you gain hit points equal to 1 + your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1). If you are in hybrid form, you gain
        these hit points before you must make the saving throw for your bloodlust.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Brand of the Voracious</h2>
    <p>
      Starting at 15th level, you have advantage on the saving throw for your bloodlust while in hybrid form. Additionally, your Brand of
      Castigation can now bind a foe to your hunter' ferocity. While in your hybrid form, you have advantage on attack rolls against a creature
      branded by you.
    </p>

    <h2>Hybrid Transformation Mastery</h2>
    <p>
      At 18th level, you have mastered your inner predator. You can use your Hybrid Transformation feature an unlimited number of times, and your
      hybrid form lasts until you revert to your normal form, fall unconscious, or die.
    </p>
    <p>
      You also gain the Blood Curse of the Howl for your Blood Maledict feature. This doesn't count against your number of blood curses known.
