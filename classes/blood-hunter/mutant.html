    <h1>Blood Hunter: Order of the Mutant</h1>
    <p>
      The process of undertaking the Hunter's Bane ritual is a painful, scarring, and sometimes fatal experience. Those who survive are
      irrevocably changed, and not always for the better. Over generations of experimentation, a splinter order of blood hunters honed the way in
      which hemocraft alters the body, using corrupted alchemy and toxic elixirs to alter their blood further.
    </p>

    <h2>Mutagencraft</h2>
    <p>
      When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn to master forbidden alchemical formulas known as mutagens, which temporarily alter
      your mental and physical abilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a bonus action, you consume a mutagen, whose effects and side effects last until you finish a short or long rest unless otherwise
      specified. While one or more mutagens are affecting you, you can use an action to focus and flush all mutagens from your system, ending
      their effects and side effects.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mutagens are designed for the specific biology of the character who concocted them, and your mutagens have no effect on other creatures.
      They are also unstable by nature, losing their potency over time and becoming inert if not used before you finish your next short or long
      rest.
    </p>
    <table class="table table-striped">
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Blood Hunter Level</th>

    <h2>Formulae</h2>
    <p>
      The number of mutagens you can concoct when you finish a rest, and the number of formulae you know, increases as you gain levels in the
      blood hunter class, as shown on the Mutagencraft table above. Additionally, when you learn a new mutagen formula, you can replace one
      formula you already know with a new mutagen formula. You choose four mutagen formulas to learn, and you can concoct one mutagen when you
      finish a short or long rest.
    </p>

    <h2>Strange Metabolism</h2>
    <p>
      When you reach 7th level, your body begins to adapt to toxins and venoms, ignoring their corrupting effects. You gain immunity to poison
      damage and the poisoned condition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, you can trigger a burst of adrenaline that lets you temporarily resist the negative effects of a mutagen. As a bonus action,
      you can ignore the negative side effect of one mutagen affecting you for 1 minute. Once you do so, you can't do so again until you finish a
      long rest.
    </p>

    <h2>Brand of Axiom</h2>
    <p>
      At 11th level, your mutagenic hemocraft lets your Brand of Castigation reveal a foe's true nature. Any illusion or invisibility in effect
      on a creature when you brand it ends, and the creature can't benefit from invisibility or illusion effects while branded by you. If a
      creature branded by you is in an alternative form (by way of the Polymorph spell, the Change Shape action or Shapechanger trait, the Wild
      Shape feature, and similar effects), it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or revert to its true form and be stunned until the end of
      your next turn. Whenever a branded creature attempts to alter its form, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the attempt fail,
      and it is stunned until the end of your next turn.
    </p>

    <h2>Blood Curse of Corrosion</h2>
    <p>
      Starting at 15th level, your blood curse can infuse a creature's body with terrible toxins. You gain the Blood Curse of Corrosion for your
      Blood Maledict feature. This doesn't count against your number of blood curses known.
    </p>

    <h2>Exalted Mutation</h2>
    <p>
      At 18th level, your body has adapted to produce mutagens naturally in a moment of need. As a bonus action, choose one mutagen currently
      affecting you. Its effects and side effects end, and you can immediately have a mutagen you know the formula for take effect in its place.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Hemocraft modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish
      a long rest.
