    <h1>Blood Hunter: Order of the Profane Soul</h1>
    <p>
      Blood hunters belonging to the Order of the Profane Soul push the limits of hemocraft for use against the most terrifying creatures
      corrupting the world. The founders trusted their resilience as they delved into the same well of corrupting arcane knowledge, making pacts
      with lesser evils to better combat the greater threats. And though they might have traded a part of themselves for their power, the members
      of this order know the benefits of that power far outweigh the price.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>
        If your blood hunter is part of the Order of the Profane Soul and also has warlock levels, add one-third of your blood hunter levels
        (rounded down) to your warlock level and consult the warlock progression table for total spell slots, cantrips known, and spell slot
        level. You should consider aligning your Otherworldly Patron feature between both classes, but your DM might allow you to have two
        different patrons at their discretion.

    <h3>Otherworldly Patron</h3>
    <p>When you reach 3rd level, you strike a bargain with an otherworldly being of your choice from the warlock class page.</p>
    <p>The choice you make augments some of your subclass features, as noted below.</p>

    <h3>Pact Magic</h3>
    <p>
      When you reach 3rd level, you can augment your combat techniques with the ability to cast spells. The spells you can learn can be found on
      the Warlock spell list.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Cantrips.</strong> You learn two cantrips of your choice from the warlock spell list. You learn an additional warlock cantrip of
      your choice at 10th level.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Spell Slots.</strong> The Profane Soul Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have. The table also shows what the level
      of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your warlock spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a
      spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, when you are 8th level, you have two 2nd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell Witch Bolt, you must spend one of
      those slots, and you cast it as a 2nd-level spell.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher.</strong> At 3rd level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the warlock spell
      list.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Spells Known column of the Profane Soul Spellcasting table shows when you learn more warlock spells of your choice of 1st level and
      higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what's shown in the table's Slot Level column for your level. When you reach
      13th level, for example, you learn a new warlock spell, which can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the warlock spells you know and replace it with another spell from
      the warlock spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Spellcasting Ability.</strong> Your chosen Hemocraft ability (Intelligence or Wisdom) is your spellcasting ability for your warlock
      spells, so you use your Hemocraft ability whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Hemocraft
      modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a warlock spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Spell save DC =</strong> 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Hemocraft modifier.</p>
    <p><strong>Spell attack modifier =</strong> your proficiency bonus + your Hemocraft modifier.</p>

    <h2>Rite Focus</h2>
    <ul class="list-unstyled">
      <li>
        Starting at 3rd level, your weapon becomes a conduit for the power of your pact with your chosen patron. While you have an active crimson
        rite, you can use your weapon as a spellcasting focus for your warlock spells, and you gain a specific benefit based on your chosen pact.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>The Archfey.</strong> When you damage a creature with a weapon for which you have an active crimson rite, that creature glows with
        faint light until the end of your next turn. For the duration, the creature gains no benefit from any cover or from being invisible.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>The Celestial.</strong> As a bonus action, you expend one use of your Blood Maledict feature to heal one creature you can see
        within 60 feet of you. That creature regains a number of hit points equal to one roll of your hemocraft die + your Hemocraft modifier
        (minimum of +1).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>The Fathomless.</strong> You can breathe underwater. Additionally, once per turn when you damage a creature with a weapon for which
        you have an active crimson rite, you can reduce that creature's speed by 10 feet until the start of your next turn.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>The Fiend.</strong> While using the Rite of the Flame, if you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die when you roll the extra damage from the
        rite, you can reroll the die and choose which roll to use.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>The Genie.</strong> As a bonus action, you expend a use of your Blood Maledict feature to give yourself a flying speed of 30 feet,
        which lasts for a number of rounds equal to your Hemocraft modifier (minimum of 1 round).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>The Great Old One.</strong> When you score a critical hit against a creature, that creature and any other creatures of your choice
        within 10 feet of it are frightened of you until the end of your next turn.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>The Hexblade.</strong> When you successfully target a creature with a blood curse, the next time you hit that creature with an
        attack while the curse is in effect, the attack deals additional damage equal to your proficiency modifier.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>The Undead.</strong> When you take necrotic damage, you can use your reaction to halve that damage. In addition, your appearance
        changes to reflect some aspect of your patron while you have any crimson rite active.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>The Undying.</strong> When you reduce an enemy to 0 hit points, you regain a number of hit points equal to one roll of your
        hemocraft die.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Mystic Frenzy</h2>
    <p>Starting at 7th level, when you use your action to cast a cantrip, you can immediately make one weapon attack as a bonus action.</p>

    <h2>Revealed Arcana</h2>
    <p>
      At 7th level, your patron grants you the use of a distinctive spell based on your pact. You cast this spell using any pact magic spell
      slot, and can't do so again until you finish a long rest.
    </p>
    <ul class="list-unstyled">
      <li><strong></strong> You can cast Blur.</li>
      <li><strong>The Celestial.</strong> You can cast Lesser Restoration.</li>
      <li><strong>The Fathomless.</strong> You can cast Gust of Wind.</li>
      <li><strong>The Fiend.</strong> You can cast Scorching Ray.</li>
      <li><strong>The Genie.</strong> You can cast Phantasmal Force.</li>
      <li><strong>The Great Old One.</strong> You can cast Detect Thoughts.</li>
      <li><strong>The Hexblade.</strong> You can cast Branding Smite.</li>
      <li><strong>The Undead.</strong> You can cast Blindness/Deafness.</li>
      <li><strong>The Undying.</strong> You can cast Silence.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Brand of the Sapping Scar</h2>
    <p>
      Upon reaching 11th level, your Brand of Castigation feature digs dark arcane scars into your target, leaving them vulnerable to your magic.
      A creature branded by you has disadvantage on saving throws against your warlock spells.
    </p>

    <h2>Unsealed Arcana</h2>
    <p>
      At 15th level, your patron grants you the use of an additional spell based on your pact. You cast this spell without expending a spell
      slot, and can't do so again until you finish a long rest.
    </p>
    <ul class="list-unstyled">
      <li><strong>The Archfey.</strong> You can cast Slow.</li>
      <li><strong>The Celestial.</strong> You can cast Revivify.</li>
      <li><strong>The Fathomless.</strong> You can cast Lightning Bolt.</li>

    <p>
      Starting at 18th level, you learn to siphon the life energy from your fallen prey. You gain the Blood Curse of the Soul Eater for your
      Blood Maledict feature. This doesn't count against your number of blood curses known.
