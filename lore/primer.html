  <main>
    <h1>The Isles in Chaos</h1>
    <p>
      Imperator Paxus is dead, and with him died the millennium-long authority of the Liran Empire. Though the manner of his death is unknown,
      one thing is certain: his subjects, worried for the stability of the imperium, have wasted no time proclaiming their independence. All out
      war in the north is but narrowly avoided by virtue of mutually-assured destruction, while agents in the south now plot a way to twist the
      situation to their advantage.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the emperor's demise brought about more than just the end of the world's most powerful empire. Without the strong arm of Lira keeping
      order, bandits rule the roads and monsters wander ever closer to civilization, while wilderness slowly and quietly encroaches.
    </p>

    <h1>Your Station in the World</h1>
    <p>
      Though a diverse land of different races and species, the Wounded Isles are not entirely free of bias and prejudice. Racial and national
      tensions are stoked frequently by war, and your chosen race and origin will likely have an impact on your experience.
    </p>
    <h2>Human</h2>
    <p>
      Because of their number and prevalence, and the fact that the world now sits at the end of a thousand-year period of human rule, humans are
      more or less seen as the norm. However, biases may be stronger among certain individuals. Those who did not enjoy human rule, particularly
      the revolutionary elves of Sothonia, may feel more negatively toward you.
    </p>

    <h2>Elf</h2>
    <p>
      Elves are a historically combative, having made enemies of nearly everyone. It's taken a long time to outgrow that reputation, though many
      elves still have yet to step out of the shadow of Evrys the Conqueror. Regardless of your homeland you probably think you're just a little
      bit <em>better</em>—stronger, wiser, more refined—than humans and other folk, and won't appreciate that.
    </p>

    <h3>Sothonian</h3>
    <p>
      The other races aren't soon to forget the moon elves' history when it comes to international relations. Many dwarves still consider you a
      race of violent warmongers, while Liran humans may regard you as servants, and even some Alkarians see you as stuck-up tyrants. Overall,
      the Sothonians' lack of empathy tends to rub people the wrong way.
    </p>

    <h3>Alkarian</h3>
    <p>
      Unlike their northern cousins, Alkarians aren't viewed as ruthless conquerors, but wily and cunning traders. Though your merchants are seen
      by most as sleazy salesmen, the average sun elf appears to the other races as one of the friendly and fun-loving people they are.
      Traditionally-minded Sothonians, however, resent your kind for mingling with humans and forgetting your elf roots.
    </p>

    <h2>Half-Elf</h2>
    <p>
      To Alkarian elves, half-elves are just normal people. Most humans feel the same, though some Lirans may look down on you due to elves'
      status as servants in Lira. Sothonians, on the other hand, tend to view half-breeds as weak—a mixture of elf blood with something lesser,
      or even as a symbol of their servitude to humans.
    </p>

    <h2>Dwarf</h2>
    <p>
      As such an isolated and reserved people, it is diffult for most to dislike the dwarves. But that doesn't stop the Sothonians, who are still
      bitter over the inconclusive end to the elven campaign across Hircron during the Age of Conquest. And the feeling is mutual.
    </p>
    <h3>Fjellan</h3>
    <p>
      As the most common dwarves, stone dwarves are most likely to integrate themselves into the outside world. As such, they are respected by
      most as an integral part of society like any other.
    </p>

    <h3>Bjor</h3>
    <p>
      Loud, confident, and quick to anger, the Bjor prove to be a bit much for some. But most at least recognize that there's no better drinking
      partner in all the isles. The production of Alkarian steel has begun to encroach on their iron sales, and the amiable sun elves see the
      Bjor as friendly competitors, though the iron dwarves don't necessarily see it that way.
    </p>

    <h3>Myntian</h3>
    <p>
      The silver dwarves have much in common with the sun elves, both being tradesmen and travelers. As such, they have a similar reputation as
      free-spirited merhcants.
    </p>

    <h3>Rull</h3>
    <p>
      The Rull rarely interact much with non-dwarf society. Even before the elven conquest, they rarely left their strognhold at all. As such,
      not many know what to make of them. Less traveled humans and elves of the world may not even know of the existence of the coal dwarves.
    </p>

    <h3>Edelian</h3>
    <p>
      Though less common than the Rull, Edelians are more well-known by non-dwarves due to their distinctive appearance and mysterious nature.
      Stories are sometimes told of how they shy from the sun and speak with their minds. The world above is strange to them, and they are
      strange to the world above.
    </p>

    <h2>Halfling</h2>
    <p>
      Halflings are probably the most universally-liked people in the isles. Though Sothonians may look down on your kind for a general lack of
      aspiration, just about everyone else is impressed by your ability to be happy with so little, and respect the virtues of the quiet life.
      You're just about the only people in the world who have never been at war with another race, and that goes a long way.
    </p>

    <h2>Genasi</h2>
    <p>
      Like all outsiders, the genasi are seen as exotic by most. Though some are wary of them due to their genie ancestry, your folk are common
      enough that most in the big cities have seen at least one of you before. Luckily for dao genasi, the other mundane races don't know of
      their genie parents' history of slavers, but that doesn't mean other genasi don't.
    </p>

    <h2>Tiefling</h2>
    <p>
      Everything about you is like a monster from a storybook designed to scare children: from your horns to your magic to your otherworldly
      origins. At the end of the day, fiends have worked hard to earn their reputation as the vile creatures they are. Unfortunately, that
      reputation seems to have rubbed off on you, too.
    </p>

    <h2>Aasimar</h2>
    <p>
      Though rare, aasimari are typically respected by the pious and clergy alike. In the eyes of the mundane races, your celestial heritage
      marks you as a loyal and righteous servant of Good. Certain people will be more likely to trust you, but you may also draw the attention
      of an ancient evil.
    </p>

    <h2>Half-Orc</h2>
    <p>
      Whether your skin is gray or green, you're not likely to find a very welcoming world waiting for you out there. Most of your local human
      civilization simply sees you as as a reminder of the orc raid during which you were likely conceived.
    </p>

    <h2>Dragonborn</h2>
    <p>
