    <h1>The Isles in Chaos</h1>
    <p>
      Imperator Paxus is dead, and with him died the millennium-long authority of the Liran Empire. Though the manner of his death is unknown,
      one thing is certain: his subjects, worried for the stability of the imperium, have wasted no time proclaiming their independence. All out
      war in the north is now but narrowly avoided by virtue of mutually-assured destruction, while agents in the south plot a way to twist the
      situation to their advantage.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the emperor's demise brought about more than just the end of the world's most powerful empire. Without the strong arm of Lira keeping
      order, bandits rule the roads and monsters wander ever closer to civilization, while wilderness slowly and quietly encroaches.
    </p>

    <h1>The Story's Beginning</h1>
    <p>
      Yeah I have no idea what the plot of the campaign is gonna be. Maybe we'll start with some modular little adventure to get you guys
      invested in the world, and then we can continue from there based on your interests and acitons.
    </p>

    <h1>Your Station in the World</h1>
    <p>
      Though a diverse land of different races and species, the Wounded Isles are not entirely free of bias and prejudice. Racial and national
      tensions are stoked frequently by war, and your chosen race and origin will likely have an impact on your experience.
    </p>
    <h2>Human</h2>
    <p>
      Because of their number and prevalence, and the fact that the world sits at the end of a thousand-year era of human rule, humans are more
      or less the norm. But biases may be stronger among certain individuals, particularly the elves of Sothonia.
    </p>

    <h2>Elf</h2>
    <p>
      Elves are a historically combative people, having made enemies of nearly everyone. It's taken a long time to outgrow that reputation, though
      many elves still have yet to step out of the shadow of Evrys the Conqueror. Regardless of your homeland, you probably think you're just a
      little bit <em>better</em>—stronger, wiser, more refined—than other folk, and they don't appreciate that.
    </p>

    <h3>Sothonian</h3>
    <p>
      The other races aren't soon to forget the moon elves' history when it comes to international relations. Many dwarves still consider you a
      race of violent warmongers, while Liran humans may regard you as servants, and even some Alkarians see you as stuck-up tyrants. Generally,
      the Sothonians' lack of empathy tends to rub people the wrong way.
    </p>

    <h3>Alkarian</h3>
    <p>
      Unlike their northern cousins, Alkarians aren't regarded as ruthless conquerors, but wily and cunning traders. Though your merchants are seen
      by most as sleazy salesmen, the average sun elf appears to the other races as one of the friendly and fun-loving people they are.
      Traditionally-minded Sothonians, however, resent your kind for mingling with humans and forgetting your elf roots.
    </p>

    <h2>Half-Elf</h2>
    <p>
      To Alkarian elves, half-elves are just normal people. Most humans feel the same, though some Lirans may look down on you due to elves'
      status as servants in Lira. Sothonians, on the other hand, tend to view half-breeds as weak—a mixture of elf blood with something lesser,
      or even as a symbol of their servitude to humans.
    </p>

    <h2>Dwarf</h2>
    <p>
      As such an isolated and reserved people, it is diffult to find something about the dwarves to dislike. But that doesn't stop the Sothonians,
      many of whom are still bitter over the inconclusive end to the elven campaign across Hircron. And the feeling is mutual.
    </p>
    <h3>Fjellan</h3>
    <p>
      The most common dwarves, stone dwarves are most likely to integrate themselves into the outside world. As such, they are respected by most as
      an integral part of society like any other.
    </p>

    <h3>Bjor</h3>
    <p>
      Loud, confident, and quick to anger, the Bjor prove to be a bit much for some. But most still recognize that there's no better drinking
      partner. The production of Alkarian steel has begun to encroach on Bjoric business, and the amiable sun elves see the Bjor as friendly
      competitors, though the iron dwarves don't necessarily see it that way.
    </p>

    <h3>Myntian</h3>
    <p>
      Myntians are the most free-spirited and worldly of the dwarves. Though this often makes you more friends, some other dwarf cultures look
      down on your lack of respect for the old ways.
    </p>

    <h3>Rull</h3>
    <p>
      The Rull rarely interact much with non-dwarf society. Even before the elven conquest, they rarely left their strognhold. As such, few know
      what to make of you. Some humans and elves of the world may not even know of the existence of the coal dwarves.
    </p>

    <h3>Edelian</h3>
    <p>
      Though less common than the Rull, Edelians are more well-known by non-dwarves due to their distinctive appearance and mysterious nature.
      Stories are sometimes told of how you shy from the sun and speak with your minds. The world above is strange to you, and you are strange
      to the world above.
    </p>

    <h2>Halfling</h2>
    <p>
      Halflings are the most universally-liked people in the isles. Though some Sothonians may look down on your kind for a general lack of
      aspiration, most envy your ability to be happy with so little, and respect the virtues of the quiet life. You're one of the only peoples in
      the world who have never been at war with another race, and that goes a long way.
    </p>

    <h2>Genasi</h2>
    <p>
      Like all outsiders, the genasi are seen as exotic by most. Though some are wary of them due to their genie ancestry, your folk are common
      enough that most people in big cities have seen at least one of you before.
    </p>

    <h2>Tiefling</h2>
    <p>
      Everything about you resembles a monster from a storybook written to scare children: from your horns to your magic to your otherworldly
      origins. At the end of the day, fiends have worked hard to earn their reputation as the vile creatures they are, and you unfortunately
      carry that image on your shoulders.
    </p>

    <h2>Aasimar</h2>
    <p>
      Though rare, aasimari are typically respected by the pious and clergy alike. In the eyes of the mundane races, your celestial heritage
      marks you as a loyal and righteous servant of Good. Certain people will be more likely to trust you, but word spreads fast, and you may
      draw the attention of servants of Evil.
    </p>

    <h2>Half-Orc</h2>
    <p>
      Whether your skin is gray or green, you're not likely to find a very welcoming world waiting for you. Most of your local human
      civilization simply sees you as as a reminder of the orc raid during which you were likely conceived. To the orcs, you're only worth your
      weight if you're strong enough to fight, but your human blood already makes you a weakling in their eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      That's not to say that it's impossible for a half-orc to assimilate with either culture. It's been done in the past, though you'll surely
      have a harder time than other, more common races.
    </p>

    <h2>Dragonborn</h2>
    <p>
      Towering in height with glimmering scales, you certainly don't suffer from a lack of attention—whether good or bad depends on the onlooker.
      Some who look at you see the product of a twisted blood magic ritual, while others see a scaly hide that may fetch a fine price. Your
      draconic visage may also evoke bad memories in elves and dwarves.
