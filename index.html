    <h1>Welcome, Traveler</h1>
    <p>
      Take a seat by the fire. Pull up a chair and rest a while.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this website, you'll find a treasure trove of resources, instructions, and information about how to get started with Dungeons and Dragons
      5th edition. I even styled the site to look like the official rulebooks. Isn't that cute?
    </p>
    <p>
      Just about everything you could ever is right need here, so go crazy.
    </p>

    <h2>Navigating</h2>
    <p>If you look to your left, you'll see a stylish sidebar that looks a bit like the spine of a book, gold lettering and all. Pretty clever,
      right? Just click around on there to jump about the site. "Home" is this page right here, "Guide" is a start-to-finish character creation
      walkthrough, and "Resources" contains lists of every official class (plus a few popular homebrew additions) and <em>most</em> official
      races (though not as they appear in the official books).
    </p>
    <p>
      Then there's the "Lore" section, devoted entirely to the history and cultures of my own homebrew setting: The Wounded Isles. For the busy or
      uninterested player (shame on you), there is also a brief primer with just the essentials. It has a summary of the current situation at the
      campaign's start, as well as a general description of how each race is thought of by the others, for you to look over before making a
      character. Afterward, if you like, you can take a look at the "Overview" for some good-to-know information on the major players in the world.
    </p>

    <h2>A Fair Warning</h2>
    <p>
      The learned D&D player may notice, after a quick look around, that the races I've presented to you here are . . . <em>wrong</em>. Simply put,
      they're completely different from those presented in the Player's Handbook (and the other books that add races, as if we didn't have enough
      already). Well, simply put, that would be because <strong>I'm the DM, and I make the rules</strong>. When you're running a game, you can use
      whatever races and race variants you want, but at my table, I have my own system based on the history of my setting and the cultures of its
      peoples.
    </p>
    <p>Besides, when One D&D comes out, there'll be plenty of new races for you that I haven't ruined. If it's anything like 5e, we'll probably
      get about 200 before we see a single new class.
