    <h1>Character Creation Guide</h1>
    <p>
      Alright, you miserable maggots. Welcome to basic training. I am your senrior drill instructor. Here you will find every rule and resource
      from A to Z on character creation in the fifth edition of Dungeons and Dragons. By the time you leave this page, you'll know everything you
      need to know in order to make a killer persona to use in your games.
    </p>
    <p>
      This page is formatted in order, so you can read it from top to bottom for the full Masterclass experience, and join me in the creation of
      example character Shlorbak. Or, if you're looking for something specific, you can use the table of contents to jump around the page as you
      please.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you've never made a D&D character before—and I don't care how smart you think you are—I recommend doing it in order, if for no other
      reason to learn the important aspects of a character and how they all work.
    </p>

    <h1 id="race">Race</h1>
    <p>
      Like in real life, everything in Dungeons and Dragons always comes back to race. But, unlike in real life, you can pick any race you want,
      and no one is necessarily better than another. Except for half-elves. The core races (from the "core" three rulebooks) are as follows:
    </p>

    <div class="row" style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
      <div class="col-lg-6">
        <div class="drop-div">
          <h3 class="drop-btn" id="aasimar">Aasimar</h3>
          <p class="drop-item drop-aasimar">
            One of two "planetouched" core races: humans whose biology was affected by an encounter with a powerful being from another plane.
            They're vaguely angelic in nature, and have—for whatever reason—had more revisions in this edition than the ranger class.
          </p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="drop-div">
          <h3 class="drop-btn" id="dwarf">Dwarf</h3>
          <p class="drop-item drop-dwarf">
            Dwarves love to dig tunnels, drink ale, and smith things. They're loud, proud, and smaller than real people. But most importantly,
            they'r all Scottish for some reason. <a href="#" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="It's because of 18th century Scots' reputation
            as coal miners and industrial capitalists. That's also why Scrooge McDuck is Scottish, in case you were wondering. Which, of course,
            you were.">Go figure!</a> Yup, they're pretty much Tolkien dwarves, but girls don't get beards. Sorry, girls.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="drop-div">
          <h3 class="drop-btn" id="gnome">Gnome</h3>
          <p class="drop-item drop-gnome">
            Gnomes are basically smaller halflings who do engineering. So, the inspiration for Warcraft gnomes. I'm personally not a fan of these
            little freaks. They seem uninspired, more like a halfling subrace than their own thing. Actually, in first edition, they were a type of
            dwarf. They didn't even have a separate race entry.
          </p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="drop-div">
          <h3 class="drop-btn" id="half-orc">Half-Orc</h3>
          <p class="drop-item drop-half-orc">
            For decades, orcs were brutal, Chaotic Evil monsters who like to murder, pillage, and sacrifice. But over the past several years,
            Wizards of the Coast has been doing a daintly little dance around the subject of half-orc children by making orcs more humanlike, so
            you don't have to put "my mom was raped by an orc raider" in your backstory.
          </p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="drop-div">
          <h3 class="drop-btn" id="human">Human</h3>
          <p class="drop-item drop-human">
            You know what these are. At least I hope so. They're just normal people like you and me. Well, like me.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="col-lg-6">
        <div class="drop-div">
          <h3 class="drop-btn" id="dragonborn">Dragonborn</h3>
          <p class="drop-item drop-dragonborn">
            Not dovahkiin. Sorry. They're big ol' lizards who look like humanoid dragons. No wings or tails, though. Their official lore is, "No
            one knows. Write it yourself if you're so smart." And yes, female dragonborn have tits in the official art for their debut edition.
            Believe it or not, Wizards of the Coast used to know what the people want.
          </p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="drop-div">
          <h3 class="drop-btn" id="elf">Elf</h3>
          <p class="drop-item drop-elf">
            Elves are agile and hairless, and they love to climb trees. Kinda like those Egyptian cats. Sound familiar? Unlike Tolkien's elves,
            they're a little bit shorter than humans. Some writers—myself and Terry Pratchett included—think elves are boring, and decided to fix
            them.
          </p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="drop-div">
          <h3 class="drop-btn" id="half-elf">Half-Elf</h3>
          <p class="drop-item drop-half-elf">
            Half-elves are children of an elves and a humans, because the Silmarillion wasn't out when they were added to the game, and everyone
            still thought "Elrond Half-Elven" was literally half elf and half human. They're also way beyond busted in terms of mechanics, and
            always have been.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="drop-div">
          <h3 class="drop-btn" id="halfling">Halfling</h3>
          <p class="drop-item drop-halfling">
            Unlike elves and dwarves, which have precedents in Germanic folklore, halflings were invented by Tolkien. But it doesn't matter since
            TSR won that lawsuit. They're short, they're sweet, and they keep to themselves. They also have a knack for sneaking around. Just like
            a book I once read, though I can't remember the name of it.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="drop-div">
          <h3 class="drop-btn" id="tiefling">Tiefling</h3>
          <p class="drop-item drop-tiefling">
            If you're a monsterfucker, edgelord, or Homestuck fan, you know this one. Also, stay far away from me. Like aasimar, tieflings are a
            type of planetouched human. Unlike aasimar, they're eeeeeeeevil. Instead of angels, tieflings were created by fiends. And people treat
            them like you'd think.
          </p>

      </div>
    </div>

    <h2 id="flipping-the-script">Flipping the Script</h2>
    <p>
      Let this be the first lesson on this page. At the risk of quoting Pablo Picasso, you have to learn the rules like a pro so you can break them
      like an artist. The rules are a good framework, but the most important part of the game is your imagination. In the original version of
      Dungeons and Dragons (which was called <em>Men and Magic</em>—no joke), dwarves could <em>only</em> be fighters (which were called
      <em>Fighting-Men</em>—also not a joke). What's that all about?
    </p>
    <p>
      These days, things are different. Anyone can be a paladin, not just Lawful humans. Elves can reach 5th level as any class, not just as
      wizards. Anyone can listen through doors to hear what's happening on the other side, not just the thief. (Again, I am not joking. That's how
      it worked back then.) Since then, the designers have added a bunch of classes, countless races, and even six new alignments. There are more
      options now, and that's nice, but why stop there?
    </p>
    <p>
      At my table, the races don't actually work like above. They're more like this:
    </p>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-lg-6">
        <div class="drop-div">
          <h3 class="drop-btn" id="aasimar-2">Aasimar</h3>
          <p class="drop-item drop-aasimar-2">
            Aasimari are exactly the same thematically, but now with three subraces based on different kinds of celestials: mana, asura, and
            couatl. I made one of those up, but the other two are real D&D things. Each subrace has its own unique abilities, and they all have
            wacky otherworldly appearances to make them more distinct from humans. I also changed the plural from aasimar to aasimari, because fuck
            you. It sounds way better.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="drop-div">
          <h3 class="drop-btn" id="dwarf-2">Dwarf</h3>
          <p class="drop-item drop-dwarf-2">
            I won't pretend Tolkien's dwarves aren't a bit one-note. They're cool, but they're just not as fleshed out as men or elves. But most
            fantasy writers don't bother expanding on them. In <em>my</em> world, I decided to give them an interesting history and cultural
            schisms. There are five dwarven strongholds born from five different mining colonies, and each has its own culture, language, and
            genetic traits.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="drop-div">
          <h3 class="drop-btn" id="genasi-2">Genasi</h3>
          <p class="drop-item drop-genasi-2">
            This is another planetouched race, but instead of being touched by celestials or fiends, they're genie people. Not like in Aladdin, but
            they do grant wishes. These genies are elementals, and there are four kinds: efreet, djinn, marids, and dao. Each is associated with
            one of the four elements. They're all funny colors, most of them have silly hair, and they have cool elemental magic powers.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="drop-div">
          <h3 class="drop-btn" id="half-orc-2">Half-Orc</h3>
          <p class="drop-item drop-half-orc-2">
            I split orcs into two categories: the gray-skinned, mountian-dwelling Ezakh; and the greenskinned, jungle-dwelling Yacal. Ezakh are
            larger and stronger, and they raid and pillage nearby human villages for fun. Yacal are slightly shorter, brutally ruthless masters of
            guerilla warfare. Both partake in violence and savagery (ritual and otherwise), and neither are super friendly toward outsiders.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="drop-div">
          <h3 class="drop-btn" id="human-2">Human</h3>
          <p class="drop-item drop-human-2">
            Since humans are the only non-magic race, they can sense magic. They know whether items have magical properties, and they can smell a
            distinct scent when spells are cast. Since all the races live for hundreds of years, humans are kind of like the sea turtles of the
            world, which is why the Lirans were able to overwhelm the elves with sheer numbers.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="col-lg-6">
        <div class="drop-div">
          <h3 class="drop-btn" id="dragonborn-2">Dragonborn</h3>
          <p class="drop-item drop-dragonborn-2">
            I'm not sure if this counts as a change, but I came up with an origin for dragonborn since Wizards of the Coast didn't bother. Rather
            than a naturally occurring race, my dragonborn they began as human blood sorcerers who used the blood of dead dragons in an attempt to
            gain their power. This granted them draconic abilities, but shortened their lives. Other than that, they're the same.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="drop-div">
          <h3 class="drop-btn" id="elf-2">Elf</h3>
          <p class="drop-item drop-elf-2">
            Say goodbye to immortal grace and beauty. These dudes are straight up stone cold killers, created by the fey for one purpose: murder.
            They love gladiator battles, they loathe weakness, their credit score is 800, and they don't get your jokes, because they only laugh at
            the scream of their enemies. There's also a younger elf subrace, who are like used car salesmen.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="drop-div">
          <h3 class="drop-btn" id="half-elf-2">Half-Elf</h3>
          <p class="drop-item drop-half-elf-2">
            I'm not sure how to make them distinct from elves, to be honest with you. But they're woven into the lore. Virtually every Alkarian
            (the car salesmen) has human blood because of elven imperialism, and Sothonian (the murder guys) half-elves are like mulattoes in
            American history, since Sothonians were slaves in the Liran Empire.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="drop-div">
          <h3 class="drop-btn" id="halfling-2">Halfling</h3>
          <p class="drop-item drop-halfling-2">
            I added a couple subraces, but halflings are pretty much what you would expect from the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="drop-div">
          <h3 class="drop-btn" id="tiefling-2">Tiefling</h3>
          <p class="drop-item drop-tiefling-2">

          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p style="margin-top: 2rem;">
      As for our brave hero Shlorbak, let's say he's an elf. There is someone quite dear to me with some deep-seated psychological issues, and she
      has a thing for elves.
    </p>

    <h2 id="racial-traits">Racial Traits</h2>
    <p>
      All these different races don't function exactly the same, of course. Every one has its own individual characteristics. Each race has a
      handful of unique traits, but there are also four or five that they all share:
    </p>
    <ul class="trait-list">
      <li>
        <strong><em>Ability Score Increase.</em></strong> Each race gains a small bump to one or two ability scores. For example, gnomes get a
        permanent +2 bonus to their Intelligence score.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong><em>Age.</em></strong> This is the only one that has no mechanical impact on the game. Older editions had rules for aging, but 5e
        doesn't, as far as I know. It's basically just here to tell you how long each race lives, so that you can decide how old your character
        will be.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong><em>Alignment.</em></strong> When fifth edition was first released, all the races in the Player's Handbook had this trait, which
        describes which alignments they tend to favor. I think they stopped using this one in supplemental releases, but I'm making it cool again.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong><em>Size.</em></strong> Only barely more relevant than age in this edition. Per the rules as written, unless you're trying to move
        through someone else's space or grapple a Large creature, I don't think you'll ever consult this stat. But it's there.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong><em>Speed.</em></strong> This trait dictates how far you can move in a single turn. As a rule, 30 feet is the standard for Medium
        creatures, and Small creatures move 25 feet. Dwarves are a notable exception, with a Medium size and a Small speed.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong><em>Languages.</em></strong> Different people speak different languages. You can expect everyone to speak at least one common
        language (usually called "Common," or something equally boring), but some races may start with more.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="subrace">Subrace</h2>
    <p>
      Many races are further divided into different categories based on physiology. And if you're playing with my custom race changes, almost all
      of them are. When you play as a race with multiple subraces, you simply choose one. The listing for each race makes it clear which traits are
      unique to which subrace, and which traits are shared by all subraces.
    </p>

    <h1 id="ability-scores">Ability Scores</h1>
    <p>
      Pay attention, because this part is important. These are the things that you're gonna consult every single time you make a roll for the rest
      of your life. You have to remember these, so take notes on this section.

      Okay, I may have fibbed a little right out the gates. You won't consult your ability scores every time you roll dice. In fact, you'll almost
      never consult them, unless you want to know how long you can hold your breath, or how far you can jump with a running start.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <em>real</em> important thing is the <strong>ability score modifier</strong>. Modifiers are numbers that <em>modify</em> your rolls.
      They're determined by your ability scores (like on the table). Higher score? Higher modifier. Lower score? Lower modifier. Super lower score?
      Negative modifier.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ability scores are really just relics of older editions. They have to be in the game, because veteran tabletop gamers (myself included) would
      whine and cry and scream if they were removed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whoa whoa, drill instructor," I hear you saying, "slow down! I don't even know what my ability scores are, much less my modifiers." Well, if
      you'd shut the fuck up for a second and let me get to it, maybe you would be a little wiser for it. There are actually four ways to find out
      your ability scores.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you're done generating, though, don't forget to add your racial bonus to get the total.

    <h2 id="the-classic">The Classic</h2>
    <p>
      This is the first one listed in the Player's Handbook. It's basically the norm, hence the name. It's also called the 4d6 method, or the
      "4d6 drop one" method, for reasons that will become obvious in a second. Tried and true, we've been using this one to come up with our stats
      since third edition, when this method became the default.
    </p>
    <p>
      To use this method, roll 4d6 (four of the cube ones). Then, take away the lowest roll of the four, and add the remaining three together. It
      gives you a value between 3 and 18, but that trends toward the upper half of the range. This was conceived as the "easy" method for earlier
      editions, but would later become the first choice.
    </p>

    <h2 id="the-standard">The Standard</h2>
    <p>
      If you're some kind of pussy who's afraid of gambling, and random numbers are too scary for you, this method is probably a little better for
      you. You get an array of 8/10/12/13/14/15, and you get to use each score once. This way you have some high scores, some not so high scores,
      and a low score. It's quick, it's simple, and it's a good jumping off point for characterization if you're not the backstory type.

      If the standard array is a little too safe for you—a little too rigid, or corporate— but you like the control it gives you, then this may be
      your option of choice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of being assigned a fixed stat lineup and distributing it yourself, you get to <strong>buy</strong> each ability score with a special
      unique point system. It's like a fun little game. For accountants.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each ability score starts at 8 by default, which costs you 0 points. If you want to increase one of your scores, you gotta spend a little,
      and they get more expensive the higher you go. Or, you can decrease your scores to refund points.
    </p>
    <p>
      The objective of this little game is to get an ability score array you're happy with, without spending any more than 27 points. Funny enough,
      the standard array from the last method costs exactly 27 points.

      Maybe you're a bit of a daredevil. Maybe you're a sadist. Whatever you are, you think character creation is too <em>easy</em>. Where's the
      fun in having an ability score array that you like? Well, my psychotic friend, here's the answer you're looking for.
    </p>
    <p>
      This one is basically exactly like the Classic, but with a twist. Instead of rolling 4d6, you roll 3d6. Drop nothing. This is how shit got
      done in first and second edition. What's that? You rolled three 1's? Fuck you. In fact, it was worse. You had to roll each stat in order
      before choosing your class. Want to play a wizard, but got 18 Strength and 6 Intelligence? Fuck you. In fact, you didn't even roll. Your DM
      did it for you. And fuck you, just because.

      Creating a D&D character is kind of like American political discourse. Some people are so distracted by race, that they are blind to the
      real issue: class. I don't fucking know. I'm trying to tie it together with the last section. I thought that was pretty good.
    </p>
    <p>
      Class is the meat and potatoes of your character. The bread and butter. Other food. The majority of the stuff written on your character sheet
      is stuff determined by your chosen class. And you'll keep writing more stuff determined by your chosen class for the entire game. Unless you
      never level up, which would be weird. But you get the idea.

      Have you ever played a video game? In that video game, was your character's general aliveness tracked via a number labeled <em>health</em> or
      <em>vitality</em>? If so, say "Thank you, Gary Gygax."
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, Dungeons and Dragons was the first ever game to assign a single character a hit point value to determine their aliveness. Before D&D
      came out, hit point-like systems represented how many men were in each unit you controlled in your favorite war game.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most games today use a fancy exponential curve to handle stat progression, but back in the day, it was generally assumed that you didn't have
      to pass algebra II in order to play. So, they used the next best thing: random chance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gary and his buddies came up with a solution: hit dice. <em>Hit</em> Points were determined by <em>Hit</em> Dice, and they have been ever
      since. And they're pretty much exactly what they sound like: dice that you roll to determine your hit points.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each class has its own hit die, that you roll each time you gain a level. The number you roll is the number you add to your hit points. But
      when you're first level, the game decides to go easy on you, so everyone automatically gets a max roll. Annoying? Maybe. Easier than the
      equation used for Vitality in Dark Souls? Absolutely.
    </p>

    <h2 id="class-proficiencies">Proficiencies</h2>
    <p>
      You don't become an expert at fighting or ranging or . . . sorcering . . . without picking up a certain skillset along the way. To represent
      this, each class grants you a number of proficiencies. Typically they're weapons and armor, but all classes also gain 2-4 skill
      proficiencies, and a few also grant tool proficiencies.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you've taken a peek at your character sheet, you may see a box on there labeled "Proficiency Bonus." If you're sensing a connection,
      you're quicker than I thought. When making a roll with a skill, you normally take the result of the roll and add your relevant ability
      modifier. But if you're proficient with the skill (or tool) you're using, you <em>also</em> add your proficiency bonus.
    </p>
    <p>
      At 1st level, your proficiency bonus is a +2. At 5th level, and every 4 levels after, it permanently increases by +1. Unlike other features
      listed on the class page, it doesn't actually scale with class level, but total character level. So, a 5th level warlock would have the
      same proficiency bonus as a character with 2 levels of cleric and 3 levels of druid (for whatever reason).
    </p>

    <h2 id="class-eqeuipment">Starting Equipment</h2>
    <p>
      You can't do your sorcering without some tools of the trade. Actually, sorcering requires very few tools compared to fighting and ranging,
      but that's beside the point. The point is, this isn't your first day out the academy. Even at 1st level, maybe it's your second week out the
      academy. And you have some stuff to help you along the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Generally, you'll start with a weapon, some kind of armor, a spellcasting focus if you need one, and some gear you can use to do things like
      light torches and open blocked doors. You can find a full list of weapons, armor, and adventuring gear in the Resources section of the site.
    </p>

    <h2 id="class-features">Class Features</h2>
    <p>
      Now this is why we're here. Number one most important thing on the character sheet. For most classes, you'll be gaining a new ability every
      level or two. There's honestly not much I can say about these, since they're all different (escept for Spellcasting and Fighting Style and
      Evasion and Channel Divinity and Expertise and maybe a few others).
    </p>
    <p>
      But yeah, be sure to write these down.  Each class and all of its class features can be found under the Classes category of the Resources
      section on your sidebar.
